	<h4>The Youth and the Legendary Sword</h4>
	<strong>Unlock at Lv10</strong>
	<br /><br />
	A lone hero destined for greatness in another world.<br />Orphaned from birth, he was brought up by the friendly village elder of the village of Potos. However, he was treated as an 'outsider' by the other adults of the village, and was routinely tormented by local bullies.<br /><br />Though he was by all appearances an ordinary boy of somewhat weak constitution, his life changed completely when, by chance, he pulled from the earth a legendary sacred sword which had lost its power due to mana attenuation.<br />The alienated youth was thereafter driven out of the village by superstitious villagers who believed that the removal of the sacred sword would bring calamity to the village.<br /><br />Moreover, in order to restore the sacred sword to its original power, the youth would need to learn true courage.
