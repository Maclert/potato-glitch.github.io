	<h4>Ice Knight</h4>
	<strong>Unlock at Lv10</strong>
	<br /><br />
	He was the ice knight who served under White Knight Melza in order to defeat the God of Ruin, Lougseus.<br /><br />From his youngest days in the Kingdom of Mordana, Seilios was considered a natural swordsman. Many said that he would someday come to represent the kingdom, and he labored tirelessly to meet their expectations until he gained real confidence in his swordplay.<br /><br />“I’ve long trained as a swordsman. I imagine my bladework is worth something.”<br /><br />However, this surety may have led him to feel ambivalent about his liege Melza, to whom he was fiercely loyal. Both Seilios and Melza were members of the aristocracy – Seilios’ family had for ages served under Melza’s and as such prized their loyalty. Even as a boy he had known and ostensibly served under Melza, but Seilios kept a psychological distance from her and looked upon her with cool reserve.<br /><br />“Though Lady Melza is my master, I do not know if her power exceeds my own.”<br /><br />One time earlier in his life, Seilios failed on a mission. He succeeded in rapidly providing backup to allies who were under attack by beasts; however, his overconfidence led him to soon require backup of his own.<br /><br />“Seilios, you haven’t been hurt, have you?”<br /><br />The icy knight considered this incident a source of great shame, and he was prepared for a weighty punishment as a result of having put his colleagues into harm’s way. Ultimately though, he was dealt out nothing more than a few months’ probation. Unable to assent to the all-too-light punishment, he sought an audience with the king to appeal for a harsher penalty, but the king was just then in the midst of conversation with Melza. From their interaction, Seilios gathered that Melza had secretly requested his sentence be lenient, since Seilios was already keeping her at arm’s length.<br /><br />Believing that the relationship between Seilios and Melza seemed unlikely to improve unless something changed, he began to worry for Melza. But Melza spoke thus:<br /><br />“Very well. I’ll simply need to become worthy of his respect.”<br /><br />This display of high-mindedness and humility deeply moved him, and after becoming a knight once again, Seilios’ bluster had diminished, and he found himself wishing to grow together with her.

	<h4>Days in Pursuit</h4>

	<br /><br />
	After gaining new insight into Melza, Seilios would go on to complete many missions with her. Realizing the greatness of her character, the loyalty that he once felt for Melza soon turned into a near religious devotion.<br /><br />Those days would eventually come to an end though. In light of the tyranny of Lougseus’s rule in Granzelia – which felt particularly acute in light of a certain incident – Melza fled from the Mordanian Kingdom to defeat the God of Ruin on her own. Seilios regretted that he hadn’t been able to grasp how she felt about Louseus’s rule of the world.<br /><br />“Lady Melza, how much you must have brooded over this matter…”<br /><br />Determined to follow behind and then battle by her side, Seilios went to gather information in Mordana. Each time he grasped a lead, he would hurry off to follow it; however many of these leads soon proved to be false. Consequently, Seilios ended up traveling further than Melza, despite his late departure. On his journey he crossed paths with a plethora of beasts, and in battling left behind a wake of legends and apothegms. The most of these is surely the tale of his battle against the Snow Ape on the Lanzelian mainland.<br /><br />While pursuing Melza, Seilios visited a tiny village in the foothills of the mountains of Lanzelia, which had been attacked time and time again by a band of crafty Snow Apes. After discussing the issuew ith the villagers, he hurried to the apes’ mountain den and proceeded to rout them out. Immediately afterward, they hurried towards the peak and in under a minute’s time set off an avalanche there before Seilios’ eyes. But without ever hurrying, he used his blade to light up the space in front of him. In the following moment, he stopped the avalanche before it could advance any further.<br /><br />“Heh… Not too bad.”<br /><br />It’s said that following this, the Snow Apes never returned to the village again.

	<h4>Ice and Fire</h4>

	<br /><br />
	While gathering information, Seilios learned that Melza was in the interior of the Lanzelian mainland – and he thereby happened upon another valuable clue. It was rumored that Melza was in league with a knight who specialized in the power of flame. If Melza in fact had run off to travel with a stranger, it was possible that a silver-tongued swordsman had deceived her.<br /><br />“Melza may be strong, but she can be simple in a way. It’s not altogether unthinkable that…”<br /><br />Hastening to the Lanzelian mainland after his beloved liege, Seilios at last caught sight of her around the Grand Wall. He raced towards her and entered the fray as – for reasons unknown – she battled with the Lanzelian Kingdom’s knights. Together, the two declared victory in mere moments. Melza was stunned by her vassal’s sudden entrance; it took all that Seilios had, however, to express his infinite gratitude for their reunion and for Melza’s safety.<br /><br />“How dare you treat Melza so!”<br /><br />Unable to contain his indignation, Seilios thrust himself forward to serve as Melza’s human shield, and attacked the rival swordsman headlong. The blow should have served to damage but not kill the blader, and it sent him flying backwards – however, he parried Seilios’ attack at just a finger’s distance.<br /><br />“What!?”<br />“What on earth are you doing?!”<br /><br />The liege and vassal couldn’t help but raise their voices. Naturally enough, the same could be said of the ambushed swordsman, but Seilios was flabbergasted that his perfectly timed blow was repelled by the swordsman.<br />And as a result he understood not through reason but rather with instinct: the swordsman’s faculties were rare equals to his own. Having come to the same realization, the swordsman immediately stepped back from Seilios and raised his brand once more. Not an instant later, the two fighters clashed and their blades sent sparks flying. During the unrelenting battle, Seilios cracked a smile in spite of himself – it was his reaction to the joy of challenging someone who was his equal. But the fight would end momentarily.<br /><br />“Stop, both of you!”<br /><br />Melza quickly intervened in the pair’s conflict. She then explained that the swordsman standing in front of him was trustworthy. She then, in turn, explained that Seilios was in fact a hometown acquaintance of hers. While he was still unsure what to make of Melza’s apparent alliance with the uncouth-at-best swordsman, Seilios sheathed his blade for the time being. Unwilling to leave Melza in the hands of the mysterious sword fighter, Seilios half-forced himself into his liege’s party in their journey to defeat the God of Ruin.

	<h4>Beyond the Battle</h4>
	<strong>Unlock at Lv80</strong>
	<br /><br />
	Having gained the power to defeat the God of Ruin, Melza and company prepared to dive into Lougseus’s Castle – however, blocking their path was one of the most powerful of the god’s ilk, a Lord of Ruin. The three sieged upon the foe but soon struggled simply to hold their ground against him, let alone make any headway.<br /><br />“i should halt him in his tracks to allow Melza and him to flee…”<br /><br />While considering how to act, his gaze met with that of the flame-wielding swordsman. Gathering from each others’ expression that they were thinking the exact same thing, the pair settled on a course of action that they hadn’t considered up until now.<br /><br />“Melza, the two of us will stop him. I beg you, please escape.”<br />“That’s right, us two’ll handle things here.”<br /><br />The two swordsmen intended to battle in cooperation so that Melza could flee. Determined to fight as part of the trio, Melza at first attempted to stop them, but seeing the fire in their eyes, she quietly told them that she’d be waiting for them in the distance and left the battlefield behind. Having confirmed that Melza departed safely, Seilios let out a sigh of relief. But not a moment later, he and his compatriot were struck to the ground with an overpowering attack from the Lord of Ruin. Despite their apparently dire situation, a feeling of ease came over Seilios when he heard the swordsman speak with the same nonchalance as ever.<br /><br />“Here goes nothing. Don’t be too late!”<br />“And the same to you too!”<br /><br />Seilios and the swordsman shared goals and their determination. Their close coordination was, little by little, able to reverse the tides of battle and put the Lord of Ruin on the defense. After a series of ferocious attacks, the duo dealt an enormous blow to the Lord and caused him to lose his balance. Seeing the opportunity, they launched a series of rapid but dreadfully powerful attacks. Seilios was certain of his victory, but in the following moment, the two allied warriors were hurled to the ground. Though it was impossible to say just what that power was, it surely originated from one of the Lords of Ruin.<br /><br />“How could I have imagined that I’d need to display this form to you? You have done well for humans. But this has come to an end. In your final moments, you will surely regret having turned your back on a god.”<br /><br />Before Seilios and his ally knew it, their blades had been stolen by the Lord of Ruin, who had transformed into an even more dreadful form and then let a torrent of magic flow.<br /><br />It was clear that the magic was being directed at the pair, but they were helpless to avoid it. Still, though, Seilios did not despair.<br /><br />“I am with Melza. So long as Melza lives, I too will survive!”<br /><br />Unfazed by the upright knight’s words, the Lord of Ruin mercilessly let his magic flow. Seilios and the swordsman were swallowed up by a tremendous whirlpool of ice and flame…<hr />How much time had passed since then? Seilios awoke to an agonizing pain all throughout his body. The surroundings were pitch black, and he found himself on some dead stone surface. All he could say for sure was that somehow, just somehow he had held on to his life’s breath. After checking his own pulse, he stood up, took in his surroundings and whispered to himself.<br /><br />“Where could that ignoramus be? Surely he wouldn’t die of wounds this insignificant.”
