	<h4>The All-Consuming Thundercloud</h4>

	<br /><br />
	Right before the war with the God of Ruin, a storm had approached the continent of Aldana – one strong enough to level cities. As time passed and the war began, many came to believe that the storm had been a warning to humanity, a harbinger of the war to come.<br />This storm’s ferocity was in a league of its own, and the intense rains it caused washed away all the towns in its path.<br /><br />The tornadoes it produces have a peculiar shape that has come to symbolize the intense fear that has plagued the people who encounter the storm time and time again. Its image is burned into the minds of those who live to tell the tale.<br />The king of one particular kingdom, in fear and awe of the storm, named it the “Towering Thundercloud Zellania”.<br /><br />Zellania produces gigantic tornadoes that are instantly recognizable at a glance. Many eyewitness accounts describe several dragons flying around these tornadoes. Apparently, these sightings have led to rumors that the storm is in fact caused by the airborne Beasts.<br /><br />The testimonies of kings and citizens from countries damaged by Zellania appear to back up these claims, and traces of flying dragons have been found near where these tornadoes occurred. <br />Specifically, we have compiled testimonies of people who have experienced the storm firsthand, and we have asked them what they believe caused the storm.<br />First, allow us to introduce the testimony of the aforementioned king who named the storm.

	Our nation has waged war with the Beasts time and time again. However, we have never done something as reckless as wage war with a force of nature.<br />We are gentlemen, and thus we respect nature.<br /><br />What did we do wrong?<br />Without heeding our respect or attitude, the storm washed away the vast majority of our domain in an instant, as if it were a powerful Beast.<br />When you’re up against a living creature, no matter how strong it may be, you always have the option to fight, and sometimes you have the option to talk things out. But when you’re up against a storm, there’s no way to fight it, and no ears to hear your words.<br />Have we no option but to watch as city after city is washed away?…<br /><br />I have never felt this powerless since the time we had to face armies of Beasts invading our kingdom.<br />Now that I recall that time, their invasion was truly like a raging storm. However, no matter how strong they were, we were still able to overcome them.<br />There has to be a way to overcome this life-threatening storm as well. We must not give up. As a statesman, I must lead the people. In order to fight the enemy, we must make our enemy clear.<br /><br />So, I shall give this storm a name.<br />Is there any name more appropriate for this Beastly storm than the name of the ferocious Beasts we once fought?<br />Zellania… From this day forth, let us call it the “Towering Thundercloud Zellania”.<br /><br />– Excerpt from the diary of a certain king of a certain kingdom<br /><br />Next, allow us to introduce the testimony of a citizen who survived the storm.

	The last time that storm came around here was about three months ago, I think? The king gave it some pretentious name like Towering Thundercloud Zellania.<br /><br />The storm was particularly terrible last time. Just about all of the crops we worked so hard to grow, were washed away. On the other hand, I guess we should be thankful we didn’t lose the whole town.<br />Anyway, some really unlucky people had the roofs of their houses blown off, if I remember correctly.<br />Everyone’s taking turns trying to take care of the people who lost their homes. I got help during the last storm, so now I’m returning the favor. Cooperation’s key in times like these.<br />But seriously, it’s a pain that the storm keeps wrecking everything. As the days go by, I can just feel it getting stronger.<br />Unfortunately, us humans aren’t that strong. There’s not much we can do when the land keeps getting ravaged.<br />Why’s the storm always after the same place, anyway? I’m starting to think that the storm’s got a mind of its own and is singling that place out.<br /><br />Now that I think about it, there was a horde of dragons flying around the tornadoes too.<br />You think those dragons are shaping the path of the storm?<br />It’s not like they’re attacking our town directly, but if they’re guiding the tornadoes here, it’ll end up being the same result.<br />Nobody knows why those things are flying around tornadoes, but if the dragons really are controlling them, I wish they’d knock it off and lead them somewhere else.<br /><br />– Excerpt from a survey of victims of the Towering Thundercloud Zellania

	From the king’s and citizen’s testimonies, we’ve learned about the influence the Towering Thundercloud Zellania has had on humanity.<br />From the citizen’s account, we learned of the existence of dragons flying around the tornadoes. Rumor has it that the dragons are manipulating them. While the situation is yet unclear, we have read a detailed testimony from a scientist concerning a dragon discovered on the continent of Aldana directly after the storm had arrived.<br /><br />The scientist had saved this dragon after it had sustained an injury rendering it unable to fly.<br />While humans helping Beasts was rare in this day and age, the scientist felt he might be able to gain some insight in return for rescuing it.<br />While the dragon was in no position to refuse his questions, it seems it did not open its heart to him any more than necessary.<br /><br />According to what the scientist gleaned from the Beast, the Towering Thundercloud Zellania was not created by dragons. In fact, the dragons are apparently challenging the tornadoes.<br />As for the reason, the dragon said it was to retrieve an important treasure hidden within. Said treasure was originally enshrined and protected in a safe location by the dragons’ ancestors, but was stolen by an evil, greedy human.<br />The power sleeping in the treasure was unleashed, and it was that power that created the storm. It is suspected that if the dragons reclaimed the treasure and returned it to its original place of safekeeping, the rampaging power would settle.<br /><br />The dragon said these last words to the scientist before flying away:<br /><br />“We sympathize with the innocent humans caught up in the collateral damage, but the situation was started by the greedy, selfish act of one such human, was it not?”<br /><br />The reason why the Towering Thundercloud Zellania keeps approaching a continent inhabited by humans may just be the dragon treasure’s way of cursing humanity for dragging it out of the place it was meant to be.
