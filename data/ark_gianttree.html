	<h4>The Giant Island Tree</h4>
	<strong>Unlock at Lv2</strong>
	<br /><br />
	There exists an enormous tree which can be seen from the harbor on Migal Island.<br />It is known as the Giant Tree.<br />Tourists visit the island to see it, and Giant Tree miniatures are a popular souvenir.<br /><br />Though innumerable people may wish to visit this symbolic tree of Migal, to reach its roots requires a perilous journey through rugged mountains and deep forests where fairies dwell.<br />Only a select few have seen the tree up close. As a result, the true nature of the Giant Tree is largely unknown to tourists or the island’s inhabitants that adore it so.<br /><br />Those few who have reached the tree have provided vague stories of their journey, and all lacked the means to research or study the tree’s ecology. Within their hazy recollections, surfaced a few shared experiences found in each story.<br /><br />These shared points all revolved around reaching the tree, an event while at the tree, and their return journey.<br /><br />The first shared experience involved each traveler losing consciousness while navigating the mountain paths, only to awaken at the base of the tree.<br />Could it be that this loss of consciousness hints at some magical property the tree carries?<br />It should be noted that not all lost consciousness int he same way, however. Some became disoriented and lapsed into exhaustion, while others sustained injury and were unable to move. Within the stories of the injured travellers lies one especially fascinating detail.

	<h4>Mystery of the Giant Tree</h4>

	One such traveler who was making his way to the Giant Tree twisted his ankle so badly it caused him to pass out on the mountain roads. When the pain jolted him awake, he found himself sprawled out somewhere new, bathed in a soft, warm light.<br />The man would later return and attest he had awoken at the base of the Giant Tree, a pleasant and comforting place surrounded by greenery. In a haze, the man could just make out the image of an enormous tree trunk and a sea of leaves before blacking out once more.<br />Upon coming to, the man said he found himself at the entrance to the mountain road where he began his journey, his wounds and pain miraculously cured.<br /><br />Several others similarly reported that they found themselves at the tree bathed in a calming light before being transported back to the base of the mountain. Each said they were saved by the divine protection of the Giant Tree.<br />They seemed to believe that this light was the divine power of the tree, a cure that healed their bodies.<br />Some say the light came from Pokkles floating through the sky. Others say that its glow came from luminescent insects. But no one truly knows the source of the light.<br /><br />Regardless, these stories cemented the belief that the tree held a mysterious power. While one such spectacular story was being told, a scholar interjected: “There’s no way a tree could have the desire to protect human life!<br />Supposing a tree could even host such magical abilities, it’s preposterous to assume it could exercise the free will to use them.”<br /><br />The scholar decided to perform his own study of the tree in order to prove his theory. However, he had much trouble navigating the path to the tree, and his fate took a dark turn in the deep woods. <br />People assumed he had perished for a time, but he suddenly reappeared in Port Migal a few days later.<br /><br />The scholar told of his encounter with a floating light while lost in the forest, that had guided him to the base of the Giant Tree. From that day forward, even the scholar began to believe in the mystical powers and will of the tree.<br />When people would inquire how he reached the Giant Tree, the scholar would state, “I was taken by the fairies,” and say nothing more.

	There are no precise records of the Giant Tree’s growth, or when it came into being.<br />Much is unknown about the tree. All that can be said for certain is that its size clearly distinguishes it from other tree. Due to its enormous size, it is assumed that the Giant Tree possesses incredible magic power beyond human imagination.<br />Some insist that this magic could be used to advance arcane research and eagerly await further reports on the tree.<br /><br />There are also records that state the tree’s will is more powerful than originally suggested. These records tell of a great tsunami that nearly destroyed Migal Island. When all seemed lost, the branches of the great tree broke and fell, forming a seawall that saved the island and its people.<br />Some scholars maintain that this was a coincidence, but since this incident, many islanders began to worship the Giant Tree as the guardian spirit of Migal.<br /><br />In order to pass on reverence of the Giant Tree to future generations, the islanders created many fables about it.<br />In one fable, prayers for healing were offered to the tree after a deathly illness spread over the island. Hearing their prayers, the tree sprinkled the island with a luminous powder, curing the sick and purging the illness.<br />Another tells of a drought threatening the island and its crops. After prayers were offered to the tree, it shot a giant beam of light into the sky and the island was showered in bountiful rain.<br /><br />Of all these tales, perhaps the most famous is the story that tells of the tree’s creation.

	<h4>Seed of the Giant Tree</h4>

	<br /><br />
	The fable of the Giant Tree’s creation is told thus.<br /><br />Migal was once a paradise where all living creatures lived together in peace. It is said that a wise sage and his disciples served as guardians of the island and maintained peace during this time.<br />Eventually, the sage’s soul faded from this world, and with it crumbled the balance of power between the disciples he protected in life. And so a feud began between the disciples over who would succeed the sage and become the protector of Migal.<br /><br />This feud was sparked by the brazen audacity of one disciple. After the death of the sage, the disciple envisioned creating a new means of protecting the island as its leader.<br />The other disciples argued against altering the balance that had been maintained up until that point, and a violent fight broke out. Fires broke out during the battle that spread from the port town to the rest of the island.<br /><br />However, one disciple who did not wish to fight, retreated from the battle and escaped into the forest. The fight had expanded beyond the disciples and turned into an island-wide war.<br /><br />In the face of unending violence, the disciple prayed for peace to return. The prayers transformed the disciple into a seed, sleeping in the soil of the forest. From the soil sprouted a bud, and this bud grew into a giant tree that covered the island.
