	<h4>Mission</h4>
	<strong>Unlock at Lv10</strong>
	<br /><br />
	Lukiel is a mysterious being with wings who secretly defeated otherworldly entities that came to Granzelia.<br />Who bore them into this world, and when? No one knows. Lukiel had no memory of it themselves. All they remembered since they came into this world is the existence of a god, their master, and the mission given by that god: to find and eliminate all otherworlders in this world.<br /><br />“Who am I? Why must I defeat the otherworlders?”<br /><br />These questions were not worth asking for Lukiel. Carrying out the mission given by their master was the only thing that mattered. Thus they focused silently and solemnly on finding otherworlders and eliminating them, as their mission states. They felt neither anger nor joy as a result. They didn't need these emotions.<br /><br />Of course, the otherworlders didn't stand passively waiting for this angelic being to slay them. The otherworlders resisted, which was perfectly natural.<br />Sometimes they used powers resembling magic or what seemed to be some sort of high-level technology. But none of their powers were a threat to Lukiel.<br />Their attacks were ineffectual against this angel's overwhelming strength, their expression never changing in the slightest as they defeated them all one after another.<br /><br />All of them, that is, save for one.

	It was a time when the people of Granzelia were growing more and more frustrated with the God of Ruin.<br /><br />On orders from their master, Lukiel traveled to the Lanzelian Mountains in search of a man who was their next target. Upon finding him, Lukiel immediately attacked with a holy sword they had created.<br />This one initial attack was generally enough to spell doom for most target. Some survived, of course, but usually only with fatal wounds and were left to die. It would be a lie to deny that Lukiel took some measure of pride in their performance in this area. But this time, things were different.<br /><br />The attack should have come as a surprise, but somehow the man avoided it easily. Taken aback, Lukiel continued to attack a second time, and a third time, but the man dodged again and again.<br /><br />“Ngh…!"<br /><br />An emotion that defied words rose up inside Lukiel, something that would've been recognized as shock for a normal person. Being shocked is of course a perfectly normal state for any living creature. But for Lukiel it was quite foreign, and thus added a brief moment of hesitation to their actions.<br />The man took full advantage of this.<br /><br />“Prepare for my secret art... Might of Heaven!”<br /><br />In that moment, the man's sword shone and struck forth. If it had hit Lukiel's head, it surely would have been fatal. However, Lukiel's instincts enabled them to partially evade it and take only minor damage.<br />Despite scarcely affecting their body, the attack had a major impact on Lukiel's mental state, and brought more emotions rushing to the surface.<br /><br />This time it was fear.<br /><br />In all other fights against otherworlders, Lukiel had never once taken this kind of damage. Lukiel was supposed to be the one that did the eliminating, not the one who was eliminated. But now that logic held unsteady.<br />For the first time, Lukiel began to question themself. By the time Lukiel realized, they had flown away from the man in a cowardly escape.<br /><br />Lukiel's master would scold them later, but the harsh words didn't sting the way they'd used to. Lukiel did, however, gain a new sense of determination. They would find the man who'd gotten into their head and clouded their thoughts — that much was certain.

	War had finally broke out between humanity and the God of Ruin. Lukiel couldn't care less about the war, but they got wrapped up in the chaos nonetheless.<br />At one point Lukiel fought against disciples of the God of Ruin who got in their way. Another time, they were attacked by knights who mistook the angel for a disciple.<br /><br />Throughout it all, however, Lukiel sought only one person — the man who had a unique fighting style with his strange sword and clothes. Lukiel faced the man countless times while the war between humanity and the God of Ruin raged on. Their confrontations caused certain emotions to begin to grow inside Lukiel.<br /><br />“I must destroy him. I have to. That hasn't changed. But the way he wields his sword... I can't match it.”<br /><br />Lukiel's emotional state was now of acceptance, recognizing the strength of the man who continually evaded their attacks. But as soon as they felt this resignation, the voice of their god and master rung out inside their heart.<br /><br />“Emotional disturbances are not allowed amongst my servants.”<br /><br />And at that moment Lukiel felt something change inside them. It was as if their consciousness left their body altogether.<br />At first they thought they'd become paralyzed. But that wasn't it. A consciousness that wasn't Lukiel's controlled their body instead.<br />Lukiel would soon realize what was going on. The consciousness controlling their body now was none other than that of their master.

	<br /><br />
	Lukiel's body, now under the control of their master, lurched out to attack the man with incredible power, and he appeared to be put on the defense by the fearsome assault.<br /><br />However, Lukiel knew. They knew this all-out attack wouldn't be enough to defeat the man.<br />Realizing what had happened to Lukiel's mind and body, the man called out to the angel. But Lukiel had no way to respond. Once the man knew he wouldn't be getting an answer, his attitude changed completely.<br />With extraordinary resolve, he called on all of his strength and focus to land a simultaneous strike. Having put everything into this attack, the man was left wide open and received a severe wound — but he'd also managed to hit his opponent.<br />His move had successfully put an end to Lukiel's offensive.<br /><br />Lukiel's consciousness now returned to their body and they regained control over it once more. And there, before their very eyes, the man was tending to Lukiel's wounds.<br />Once Lukiel realized what was going on, Lukiel spoke out in disbelief.<br /><br />“Why didn't you let me die?”<br /><br />It was a natural question to ask. All they had ever wanted was to kill the man. Lukiel didn't understand the man's reply. But hearing his words made an altogether new feeling well up inside Lukiel.<br /><br />“I lost to him when my master controlled my body. But that doesn't reflect my own abilities. Could I have beaten him if I'd fought on my own, with my own strength?”<br /><br />Lukiel told the man their thoughts. Lukiel didn't know why, but felt they should speak.<br /><br />The man listened in silence, and finally smiled back without saying a word.<br /><br />No one knows what came of the two afterwards, amidst the chaos of the war. Some say that after challenging the man once more, Lukiel headed to where their master dwelled in order to free themselves from the yoke of their master's control.
