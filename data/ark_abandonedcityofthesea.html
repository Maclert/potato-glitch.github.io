	Legends of the submerged city Nono Bakura have been told since antiquity. Some suggested that the city was founded by gods, while others said it was a remnant of an ancient civilization. The first written record of Nono Bakura was found in a navigation officer’s notebook from before the God of Ruin’s reign.<br /><br />The description goes as follows:<br /><br />Caught in the storm of Southern Aldanian Sea, we were fighting against the raging sea when I realized one of our crew members was staring out at the waves with a dumbfounded expression.<br />I was about to yell and catch his attention, but I too dropped my ropes out of disbelief. The sea to starboard was awfully calm and the water was clear, but that was not what shocked us. We witnessed rows and rows of tall buildings rising from the seabed. There seemed to be a small city.<br /><br />“Are these… some kind of ancient ruins?”<br /><br />The unfathomable sight grabbed my attention. Moments later, a great wave bashed me against the deck, and I lost consciousness. When I woke up, we had already escaped the storm and left that area of the sea. We subsequently revisited many times, but never did we ever see the city again. Was it all a mere illusion? I’m afraid I could never get an answer to this question.<br /><br />There were many similar records and stories left behind, but none could be decisively judged true. Nono Bakura was generally believed to be nothing more but a legend.<br /><br />My father – Robert Grane – and his partners were deeply convinced that the legends of the submerged city were true. Determined to find the city themselves, my father formed an expedition team to verify the location of Nono Bakura. Despite gaining a few clues from the vague records and legends, they were fortunate enough to find surviving eyewitnesses. With the help of experts on the Southern Sea, the team was able to roughly approximate the city’s location.<br /><br />However, the team came face-to-face with a greater problem. This section of the sea was known for its unpredictable currents and aggressive Beasts. It would be impossible to reach the area without hiring the finest navigation officers and mercenaries.<br /><br />For a long time after that, my father and the others did their best to raise funds for the expedition, but from his depressed appearance, I could tell that that period was very difficult for him. Things took an unexpected turn when Delnore, a wealthy investor, decided to provide funds for the expedition team. I remembered my father giving me a firm hug when he learned the news.<br /><br />With everything ready to go, it didn’t take long before the Nono Bakura expedition ship departed on its voyage.<br /><br />– Excerpt from “Men After the Sunken City” by Libert Grane

	<h4>A Light from Beneath</h4>

	The following is based on memos and stories from my father, so one must keep in mind that it may not perfectly reflect the truth.<br /><br />The expedition team reached the designated area of the sea without too much trouble. As soon as they arrived however, they were confronted by stormy waves. My father and the others did everything to keep their vessel afloat, but they were only able to move the ship to follow the current. After hours of struggle, many members were beginning to lose hope. My father, on the other hand, did all he could to keep morale high.<br /><br />As the ship followed the current, my father saw a blink below the waves. At first, he thought it was just his mind playing tricks, but the flash became undeniably obvious as they got closer.<br /><br />“It’s Nono Bakura!” one of the crew members exclaimed.<br /><br />The expedition team members leaned out their heads, trying to see below the surface. But due to the rough waves, none could see anything except the glowing light. Suddenly, that same light shined brighter, forming a great circle on the ocean surface. Within a second the storms and the waves fell still. But despite this amazing phenomenon, my father and the others did not have time to be surprised at the weather, for the stunning sights of great undersea buildings, sea creatures and the marine Beasts grabbed all their attention.<br /><br />However, the magical moment soon faded, and waves struck the ship as the light stopped glowing. The expedition team prepared a variety of equipment before embarking, but the rough waves made investigation nearly impossible. Hoping to somehow get visual proof of Nono Bakura before the ship sailed too far away, they tossed in a specially designed underwater camera. Although the expedition team wished to return for further examination, they eventually decided that neither the ship nor the crew were ready for another storm.<br /><br />On the day of their return I went to the port to greet my father and the team. They were happy to be alive but, more importantly, proud of their accomplishment. I will never forget my father’s beaming smile.<br /><br />Once back in town, the expedition team went to develop the photographs they shot. Most had captured nothing more than the empty ocean depths, but one picture alone clearly showed Nono Bakura. My father and his partners released this picture, hoping to prove the existence of the undersea city.<br /><br />– Excerpt from “Men After the Sunken City” by Libert Grane

	<h4>A Single Photograph</h4>

	After my father released that one photograph, a tragedy ensued. My father thought that some people would be forced to admit the city’s existence, but they refused. To a certain extent, it was unsurprising. People had long been doubtful about Nono Bakura and mocked my father for believing the legends. The skeptics’ derision only increased when they learned that he spent so much time and resources in pursuit of a single picture. To make the situation worse, rumors that the picture was forged eventually reached our investor, Delnore. Although my father did everything he could to argue for himself, his funds were eventually cut off.<br /><br />Not long after that, people began to call the expedition team members liars. I was also shamed as the child of a liar, making my childhood very unpleasant. Feeling overwhelmed, many of the team members left. My father tried to persuade his partners to have faith, but eventually the expedition team was dissolved. My father gave up researching Nono Bakura and passed his final days in a lifeless stupor.<br /><br />He spoke to me with his dying breath:<br /><br />“I saw it with my very own eyes… the great city on the ocean floor… No matter what the others think or believe… that will be the only truth for me.”<br /><br />And with that, he rested forever.<br /><br />– Excerpt from “Men After the Sunken City” by Libert Grane

	<h4>What Remains</h4>

	<br /><br />
	Decades later there was an unexpected development concerning Nono Bakura.<br /><br />One day after Aldana was struck by a typhoon, a fisherman’s net got snagged on a resurfaced obelisk of sorts. While investigating that monument – evidently from an ancient civilization – they recognized it from my father’s photograph of Nono Bakura.<br /><br />When people realized the photograph had been authentic, their loyalties shifted, and they praised the work of my father and his team. Scholars spearheaded a wave of new research into Nono Bakura. Personally speaking, it made me feel both contented and nostalgic to see my father’s research being continued.<br /><br />I was also invited to be part of the new expedition team. Though it might have made for a touching story if I’d joined, I declined on account of not feeling physically adequate to the task. I did, however, hand the expedition team all my father’s research materials. In the future, I will continue to support all research on Nono Bakura in whatever way I can. I’m reminded of my father’s words immediately before he set out on his final expedition.<br /><br />“The world might say that I’m a foolish man, but that will not stop me from doing what I please. I will seek after my own truth.”<br /><br />– Excerpt from “Men After the Sunken City” by Libert Grane
