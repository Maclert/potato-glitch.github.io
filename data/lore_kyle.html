	<h4>Young Imperial Knight</h4>
	<p><strong>Unlock at Lv5</strong></p>
	<p>A fresh-faced imperial knight from the village of Ladour off Aldana's east coast. One day as a child, he came across Rei, collapsed and covered in wounds, and helped him to safety. The beast and boy became fast friends and now spend their days working together, all the while exchanging barbed jokes.</p>
	<p>Having lost both parents when he was too young to remember, he was raised by Davan, a friend of his father's. They lived together in Ladour until Davan was summoned to the imperial capital due to the reputation he'd gained for himself in a beast uprising five years earlier. Kyle and Rei accompanied him and have lived in the capital ever since.<br />However, prejudice against beasts is worse in the capital than remote Ladour, and Kyle and Rei's relationship drew criticism and scorn. Kyle could endure the insults directed at him personally, but when Rei was insulted, he couldn't control himself and lashed out physically in response. Having been trained by Davan in sword-fighting from a young age, Kyle was better than most of the knights in the capital by the time he moved there.<br />But one day, he got into major trouble for beating up the son of an influential knight who had humiliated Rei. Thankfully, Davan was able to use his influence among the Imperial Knights to smooth everything over (Rei was also involved in this incident, but he emerged unscathed as well).</p>
	<p>After that incident, Kyle found himself facing less outward antagonism, though many still spoke ill of him behind his back.</p>
	<p>The days passed by, and before he knew it, he'd finished training and officially joined the Imperial Knights. To this day, Kyle is as direct and honest as ever and still gets roundly criticized for being careless. Davan keeps telling him to grow up and quit being so foolish, and Rei is always laughing at him, certain that he'll stay a fool until the end.</p>
	<h4>Bond Between Man and Beast</h4>
	<p><strong>Unlock at Lv5</strong></p>
	<p>Beasts are considered “lesser creatures” than humans in Aldana, and the two are treated differently in many aspects of society. Beasts cannot hold office, for example, and they cannot engage in trade or possess property. Imperial law limits their rights and dictates that beasts must 'live under the supervision of humans.'<br />This is largely due to the fact that the first emperor of Aldana was the son of the hero Adel who saved the world from the God of Ruin.<br />The treachery of a beast who'd fought at Adel's side led to his death, hence his son's strong dislike of beasts. This episode is taught in history lessons in school, and as a result, most people born and raised in Aldana have a negative image of beasts.</p>
	<p>Having grown up with Rei, however, Kyle has virtually none of this prejudice himself. And it's not only Rei—Kyle treats other beasts like his equal, too. Still, people do get attacked by wild beasts in the outskirts of the capital and other remote areas, so there's no shortage of ill will and outrage towards beasts among the other humans in Kyle's life. In fact, he had a phase as a child where he worried he was somehow freakish for being different.<br />When he asked Rei, all he got was an emphatic, "Who cares?!" along with a swift kick and a swollen eye.</p>
	<p>When Davan saw this, he took Kyle aside and gave him some advice:<br />"It's not as simple as 'people are good and beasts are bad.' There are good and bad souls among both. You have to decide which is which for yourself. Do you think Rei is bad?"</p>
	<p>That brought Kyle back to his normal, upbeat self, and he and Rei have remained friends ever since.</p>
	<p>Though Rei has never commented on this phase of Kyle's life, Davan sometimes pokes fun at him as if he knows something no one else does.</p>
	<h4>Famous Parental Unit</h4>
	<p><strong>Unlock at Lv50</strong></p>
	<p>During his knight training days, Kyle maintained a distance from other students. Everyone naturally envied him being raised by Davan, a general and a hero of the Battle of Granada. Moreover, no one understood why he treated beasts like his equals when almost everyone in the empire considered them to be less than humans.</p>
	<p>They all learned in class the story of the “back-stabbing beast” that had cost Adel his life, and of all the damage caused by beasts throughout the empire. His classmates saw beasts as their enemies, so they looked down on Kyle for trying to become a knight without recognizing the threat posed by beasts.<br />Also, most of his peers in knight training came from families of high social rank, which probably contributed to their thinking aligning so closely with official imperial opinion.</p>
	<p>Out of respect for Davan, some had tried to be friends during his early days, but within six months, they had all became enemies instead. Kyle didn't care however, and merely devoted himself fully to his knight training (outside the classroom, at least).</p>
	<p>His friend Zekus later said that Kyle did in fact have his fair share of struggles, but hid them because he didn't want to embarrass Davan, who was like a father to him.</p>
	<p>When Kyle and Davan are together, Kyle pokes fun at him relentlessly, but this is because of the special position Davan occupies as the only parental figure in Kyle's life.</p>
	<h4>Reason to Keep Swinging a Sword</h4>
	<p><strong>Unlock at Lv80</strong></p>
	<p>Kyle isn't thought of very highly by his fellow knights, but no one doubts his skill with a sword. In fact, their envy of him is just another reason he's disliked. However, he doesn't let that bother him and remains focused on his day-to-day training.</p>
	<p>Kyle learned swordsmanship from Davan, who was like a father to him. It's a well-known fact, however, that Davan is more skilled with an axe than a sword, and quite a few people find this strange.<br />Beyland, guildmaster of the Adventurer's Guild and a friend of Davan, once asked why Davan instructed Kyle in the sword rather than the axe. Smiling wryly, Davan responded that it was because of a promise he'd made with Kyle's father (though he didn't explain what exactly that promise was.)<br />When Kyle was asked the same question, he responded without hesitation that it was because swords are "cooler" than axes.</p>
	<p>It's anyone's guess which answer is correct, but since Kyle isn't bad with an axe, it can be assumed that Davan instructed him in both to some degree.</p>
	<p>At any rate, Davan possesses skills far beyond those of the average knight, and he's done a very thorough job of passing those skills on to Kyle.</p>
	<p>Kyle has always wanted to be stronger ever since he was young, and his motivation to train only grows more intense as the years go by. This is because the stronger he gets, the more he realizes how much stronger a certain someone is, and longs to reach their level.</p>
