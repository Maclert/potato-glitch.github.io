	<br /><br />
	The Magic Mirror Pomram… A mysterious mirror said to be hidden somewhere in the world.<br /><br />Many stories surround this artifact, ranging from claims that it grants its beholders’ wishes in twisted ways, to rumors that it is a doorway to other worlds.<br />But its true nature is mostly unknown.<br />Why? The real Magic Mirror Pomram has never been obtained.<br />But if it has never been obtained, then why have there been so many rumors about its nature…?<br />Actually, these stories find their origin in the many fake Magic Mirror reproductions circulating around the world.<br /><br />One famous tale features the wealthy merchant Lytham. Lytham was famous for his love of antiques, and he would always look for hidden gems at town marketplaces. One day, he came across a reproduction of the Magic Mirror Pomram, which he immediately purchased and brought home.<br />Nothing unusual happened to him at the time, but eventually, he began obsessively buying up every Pomram reproduction he could find until he spent his entire fortune and fell into ruin.<br />According to testimony from a close relative of Lytham’s, he was obsessed with his Pomram reproductions and would gaze into them in his free time.<br />What did Lytham see in those Magic Mirrors…?<br />Perhaps no one will ever know.

	According to legend, Pomram was made by Lagen the Conjurer.<br />Lagen was always curious. Once he began an experiment, he would immerse himself in his research day and night, even forgetting to eat.<br />Apparently, the Magic Mirror Pomram was the product of research into creating a mirror that could become a window into any given location. The research had gone somewhat smoothly, and the mirror was a success, though it only allowed the user to peer into a location a very short distance away.<br />It was when further development went into extending the mirror’s range that the anomalies began. When Lagen tried adjusting the mirror, it suddenly showed him a place he had never seen before. At that moment, the mirror demonstrated a power far beyond its creator’s expectations, and thus the Magic Mirror Pomram was born.<br /><br />Later researchers would try to get Magic Mirror reproductions to function at the distance Lagen had originally intended. However, despite countless experiments, the Magic Mirror reproductions could only peer into locations close by and failed at anything beyond that.<br />Thus, Lagen concluded that it was impossible to create a Magic Mirror that allowed one to peer into faraway places.

	The unknown location reflected in the Magic Mirror Pomram… Lagen was so fascinated by the sight that he put all of his other research on hold to dedicate himself to studying the Magic Mirror.<br />Lagen’s bizarre enthusiasm surprised his colleagues at first, but their surprise quickly turned to worry.<br />He brushed off their concern, however, and shut himself inside his laboratory, cutting off all ties to the outside world. Shocked by his behavior, his colleagues left him one by one.<br /><br />After a whole year had passed, one of Lagen’s colleagues visited his laboratory on an errand, only to find that the door – normally locked up tight – was wide open.<br />The researcher timidly went inside, but Lagen was nowhere to be found.<br />There was only a giant mirror… the Magic Mirror Pomram.<br />They would later testify:<br />“By the time I went into Lagen’s laboratory, a strange sensation overwhelmed me. It was like someone was watching me.<br />At first, I thought Lagen was peeking at me from some hiding spot, but I soon realized it wasn’t him.<br />It just felt like a different sort of gaze, I suppose. Like something was staring at me… Something not human.<br />But obviously, I didn’t let my fear get the better of me. I got straight to Looking for Lagen, calling out to him.<br />But nobody responded.<br />Lagen was nowhere to be found.<br />I thought maybe he had gone off on a journey somewhere, but there was nothing in the lab to show he’d been preparing for a trip.<br />I tried asking our colleagues as to his whereabouts, but as I feared, nobody knew.<br />There was just one thing I found mysterious. The first time I went into the room, there was a giant mirror. Lagen had called it ‘Pomram’, by the way. But the next time I visited the room, it was gone.<br />While it definitely is magic, I don’t think there’s anyone out there who would try to steal such a large object.”<br /><br />Lagen’s disappearance remains unexplained to this day, as do the whereabouts of the genuine Magic Mirror Pomram.

	The prevailing theory that has developed is that Lagen the Conjurer was so fascinated by his creation, the Magic Mirror Pomram, that it drove him mad.<br />However, an alternate theory is that Pomram connected to another world… and had gained a life and will of its own.<br />According to this theory, the powered-up Magic Mirror first brainwashed its creator, then had him make many reproductions of itself.<br />But upon learning that its low-quality reproductions were underpowered, the Magic Mirror had no more use for Lagen and consumed him.<br />Since the Magic Mirror had gone missing, this “theory” was less of a guess and more of a dubious ghost story. However, it is true that many Pomram reproductions exist in this world, and it is a mystery as to who made them and why.<br />Thus, even if it is something of a ghost story, it cannot be completely denied.<br /><br />In any case, what exactly was the location reflected in the Magic Mirror that had ensorcelled Lagen?<br />According to one dubious researcher… The mirror reflected another world where defeated gods of legend had been sealed away.<br />When the Magic Mirror Pomram happened to reflect this other world, its ancient gods granted the mirror a life and will of its own, and to this day, these gods are working to return to Granzelia.
