	<h4>Born Warrior</h4>
	<strong>Unlock at Lv10</strong>
	<br /><br />
	The Vazard are a race of beasts with a physiology that can best be described as half-man and half-dragon. They possess intelligence on par with humans and are capable of speaking human languages.<br /><br />Though it is said that many individuals of their race display a crude character, they are not fond of senseless fighting and will not attack unless given a reason to do so.<br /><br />The Vazard have a very tough body derived from their draconian nature, and prefer a fighting style that emphasizes their durability, tenacity, and strength. Therefore, all members of their race possess a level of combat ability on par with most first-class human warriors.

	<h4>The Definition of Strength</h4>

	Vazard colonies can be found scattered throughout the world. Although the nature of the precepts which govern each colony vary, there is one part of the Vazard value system which is consistent across all colonies.<br />Namely, the Vazard hold the notion of 'strength' as an absolute standard for everything.<br /><br />For example, it is said that the leadership of a given group of Vazard must be drawn from the strongest members of the colony. When the position of Vazard chief becomes vacant or when a Vazard chief senses that his power is waning, the group will hold a battle tournament where contestants fight for the position of chief.<br />Perhaps because of their strong affinity for the concept of strength itself, the temperament of the Vazard who compete in these tournaments is extremely serious and they seem to prefer a dignified contest.

	<h4>Character and Loyalty</h4>

	<br /><br />
	Due to their system of values which emphasizes “strength” above all else, the Vazard tend to look down on humans as creatures physically weaker than themselves.<br /><br />This tendency has often been a source of trouble when the Vazard deal with humans. They are not known to be particularly fond of building friendy, sustainable relationships when conducting business with humans, and will in some cases unilaterally force a transaction via extralegal means.<br />On the other hand, when they encounter anyone they regard as strong, the Vazard will display unbridled respect and will treat said individual as no different from their own race.<br />There are countless examples of how the Vazard have shown a surprising degree of friendship and loyalty to heroes in various legends and popular anecdotes. Their loyalty has been said to be of a level such that they will never betray their companions even if it means losing their life.

	Though half-human, half-dragon, the Vazard do not have wings on their back and are unable to fly. However, rumors swirl of a type of half-human, half-dragon beast with actual wings, which the Vazard regard as a superior subspecies of their own.<br /><br />It is very interesting to consider how the Vazard, with their absolute emphasis on strength, might act were they to encounter an organism very clearly superior to themselves. Some scholars believe that the Vazard would willingly submit to a race of half-human, half-dragons with wings, but the majority have expressed disagreement with this view.<br /><br />It is hard to believe that the Vazard would simply submit to a subspecies which is superior only in the possession of wings, without putting up any kind of resistance. Most scholars support the opinion that in the above case, the two subspecies would put on displays of strength, and fight until the dominance of one subspecies was established.
