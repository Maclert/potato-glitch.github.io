	<h4>The Legendary Bathhouse</h4>
	<strong>Unlock at Lv2</strong>
	<br /><br />
	Deep in the snowy mountains of Lanzelia is a legendary hot spring. The spring was discovered and set up as a spa by a half-human, half-Beast god for the benefit of its injured followers.<br />Unlike a regular hot spring, its waters are imbued with a special magical power. Any living being who bathes in its waters will find themselves restored, their regenerative abilities invigorated, and their wounds and fatigue completely healed in no time at all.<br />After its initial establishment, few ventured to the spring due to its inaccessible location, and it remained abandoned for a long time. Eventually, it was rediscovered by a group of Beasts around the time of the great war with the God of Ruin.<br />It came to be used by soldiers to heal their wounds and fatigue from battle, and is to this day frequently visited by the Beasts of Blaze.<br />It is thought that the Beasts started to use it despite having no custom of bathing, because they had some instinctual understanding that the water was beneficial.<br /><br />The hot spring is currently managed by one old man who constantly regulates the level of magic in the water. If the magic concentrations are too low, the water will lose its healing effects; if the concentrations are too high, it can stimulate energy levels and regenerative abilities far beyond necessary, causing physical damage to the body.<br />It is in large part thanks to this old man’s efforts that the hot spring water remains consistently effective.

	<h4>A Monster's Day Off</h4>
	<strong>Unlock at Lv4</strong>
	<br /><br />
	During the great war with the God of Ruin, the Beast Kainel, feared as the great “Demon Wolf” who had felled many of the god’s followers, was injured in battle while protecting his comrades.<br />The wound quickly healed and there was no danger to his life. Afterward, however, perhaps due to where he was injured, pain would lance his body with every movement and he could no longer move as nimbly as before. Even so, he still wanted to fight in order to protect his fellow Beasts.<br />But for a wolf-Beast, lacking agility on the battlefield could prove fatal. Seeing him struggle in battle and sustaining further injuries, his comrades told him of the healing hot spring.<br /><br />Kainel was loath to leave behind the scene of the battle, but he finally gave in to his comrades’ persuasions and reluctantly agreed, carrying himself off to the spring. He did not believe in the spring’s powers in the slightest, and at first he intended to simply take a few days to rest up in order to assuage his comrades. However, when he lowered himself into the water for the first time, he felt strength flowing back into his body and filling him up.<br />Shocked, he extended what had originally been a planned two or three days to a one-week stay.<br />Afterward, when he returned to battle, Kainel was even faster and nimbler than before he had been injured, running circles around his enemies. Furthermore, the slash of his claws and bite of his fangs were even stronger, transformed into truly formidable weapons. He could hold his ground even when facing off against enemies far larger than himself, and would not be pushed back even a single step.

	<h4>Territorial Dispute</h4>
	<strong>Unlock at Lv7</strong>
	<br /><br />
	The hot springs are now open to all Beasts, but in the distant past, the water’s incredible virtues were fought over by the different races of Beasts.<br />The first race seeking it for their own were the half-Beast, half-dragons known as the Vazard. Since they valued strength above all else, the Vazard believed it only natural that, as the strongest of Beasts, they should have control of the place.<br />But of course, other Beasts appeared to oppose them. The first to make a move were the Sigra – a half-human, half-tiger race. Without attempting to debate or negotiate, they simply attacked the Vazard occupying the spring.<br />After heavy losses on both sides, the Sigra emerged victorious as the spring’s new owners.<br />While they had won the right to the land fair and square through a hard battle, of course other races could not simply sit back and accept it. Next came the wolves, the dragons, and the fishfolk.<br />The fierce battles raged on, and it seemed that control of the spring would change by the day.<br /><br />The Kingdom of Lanzelia had always taken a neutral stance on the disputes of Beasts, but in this case, they deemed it possible that the damage could spill over into areas inhabited by humans. So they undertook mediations and it was decided that the spring would not belong to one race in particular.<br />It may seem strange for a human nation to participate in Beastly affairs. However, it was probably largely due to the fact that Lanzelia was relatively amicable toward Beasts and was not itself in a position to have a direct hand in the rights to the spa.<br />The place that should have been a facility for healing had become a battleground drenched in blood, and a feeling of war-weariness had already permeated among the Beasts, so they accepted the arbitration.<br /><br />Ever since then, it has been forbidden for any one race of Beasts to claim monopoly over the spring.<br />After the Lanzelian monarchy died out, Blaze Garden took on the responsibility of overseeing it.

	<h4>The Senior Administrator</h4>
	<strong>Unlock at Lv10</strong>

	There are many mysteries surrounding the old man who manages the hot springs. All we know about him is that he began managing the spa right after the mediations by the Kingdom of Lanzelia.<br />Everything beyond that is unknown: how he arrived at the spring despite its hard-to-reach location, how old he is, and even his name.<br />Apparently, he speaks not a word to any of the Beasts who come to bathe in the springs, nor have any of them ever witnessed him talking to anyone else.<br /><br />One time, some Beasts who had come to the spa were on the verge of a fight over some silly matter. The old man placed himself between the Beasts as they were about to fight, stopping them in their tracks with some inexplicable power.<br />Then, with just a single glare, he had the Beasts, who towered way above his own meager height, trembling.<br />A half-human, half-Beast who was at the scene tells the tale as follows:<br />“He’d always just watch from a distance, so we all felt this tension when the old guy got between these Beasts who were arguing.<br />Still, they didn’t stop their quarrel. I mean, they’re Beasts, what do you expect?<br />Even if they know it’s the logical thing to do, they’re not just gonna back down from a fight ‘cause someone told them to.<br />But what did stop them was the old man’s eyes. The moment he turned that glare on them, they were struck by an unbearable fear that practically turned them to stone.<br />If I were to compare it to something, I’d say it was like… being pinned down by the steely glare of a giant dragon as its wings blocked out the skies.<br />The Beasts who were fighting, and those of us around them, we all felt that same fear. Well, I’d always thought it pretty strange to have this one human hanging out there, but that old guy is no ordinary man.”
