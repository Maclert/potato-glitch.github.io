	<h4>Gate to the Underworld</h4>
	<strong>Unlock at Lv2</strong>
	<br /><br />
	According to legend, there are many places that are purported to connect the Underworld with our world, one of which is the so-called Death Noug, a portal through which only the souls of the most sinful pass.<br /><br />The designation “Death Noug” is believed to have first been used in Another Garden, a compilation of legends pertaining to the worlds visited by souls after death, such as the Underworld and even Hell itself.<br />Said text speaks of the Death Noug as follows.<br /><br />The Underworld… Is a place where those who have died and shed their corporeal form prepare for their next life in this world… that is, their reincarnation. Yet not all souls are necessarily bound for the Underworld. There are many entrances to the Underworld, and where a given soul eventually finds itself depends on how that soul conducted itself in life. Pure souls which have many good deeds to their name are ushered to the Tel Noug, while unclean souls with a preponderance of evil deeds to their name are sent to the Death Noug.<br />It is there are they are judged for their deeds in their former life, and it is decided how they will be handled in the Underworld.<br />Some souls which pass through the Tel Noug reincarnate immediately the moment they reach the Underworld, while on the other hand, many of the souls that pass through the Death Noug are not even given the opportunity to reach the Underworld, and instead face permanent extermination.<br /><br />– Excerpt from Chapter 1 of Another Garden.<br /><br />Of course, only the dead may know for sure whether the portrayal given in Another Garden is close to the truth. However, we can be reasonably certain that the moniker Death Noug has inspired fear and awe among the common people since ancient times.

	<h4>Interrogation</h4>
	<strong>Unlock at Lv4</strong>
	<br /><br />
	The Death Noug is a place where the value of the souls of the deceased are deliberated and their treatment in the Underworld is adjudicated. The God of Death Loug Dana, ruler of the Death Noug, issues the following orders to his subordinate, the Inspector.<br /><br />“Souls which appear before this gate are corrupted. For every 100, 90 shall be obliterated. As for the remaining 10, for which the possibility of redemption exists, they shall experience despair worse than death so that they might know the magnitude of their crimes.”<br /><br />The Inspector’s first duty is to compel all souls which visit the Death Noug to confess to their evil deeds in life. During this process, even the barest hint of a lie or half-truth is met with immediate annihilation. The Inspector of the Death Noug is easily able to see through lies and other mistruths spoken by any soul brought before him. During this interrogation, what really matters is not the nature of the crime to which the soul confesses. Only “whether or not the soul lies” is important.<br />Most souls are exterminated during this process, but those that manage to confess completely to their evil deeds in life are cast into a dreamworld by the Inspector. In this dreamworld, the soul is made to experience the lives of those it harmed in life through its evil deeds.<br />Naturally, the greater the number of sins committed the longer the dream will continue, and though to the Inspector and those waiting for their judgment the dream appears to be over in an instant, to the soul experiencing it the dream may seem to last several lifetimes.<br />Once the dream is over, only those who experience suffering and deep despair at the sinfulness of the acts they perpetrated are allowed passage to the Underworld. Yet passage to the Underworld itself does not entirely end the soul’s suffering. After reaching the Underworld, the soul is made to wait for what may seem like an eternity before it is allowed to reincarnate, during which time it is said to experience constant and ongoing despair and suffering.

	Loug Dana, God of Death, is the master of the Death Noug.<br /><br />The God of Death is reported to have become well known among the general populace of Granzelia upon being summoned by Melza, servant of the God of Ruin and sworn enemy of humanity. Just as Melza developed a fearsome reputation among the people as a foot soldier for the God of Ruin, the fearsome form of Loug Dana was also forever imbued in common memory.<br /><br />Thus, though Loug Dana is often regarded by the common folk as a sower of disaster and chaos, the truth is not quite so simple. Although “Death” as the domain of Loug Dana is certainly something that rightly inspires terror in humans, “Death” and “Life” are but two sides of the same coin, and without “Death” there can in fact be no “Life”.<br /><br />Although only the product of ancient legend, the following story demonstrated the above point well.<br /><br />Many eons ago, Loug Dana appeared before the princess of a powerful kingdom to tell her of her death. Though the princess was known to public as a warm and caring girl and shieldmaiden of the kingdom, she had in secret murdered many of the king’s young female attendants and concubines in a vain attempt to maintain the favor of the king.<br /><br />“In one month you will die. When that happens, I shall lead your soul to the Death Noug.”<br />The princess, hearing the god’s words was shocked to her core, but she did the best to maintain her dignity as a princess and managed to keep her composure.<br /><br />“I understand… However, I am pregnant with the king’s child. Might you wait until I give birth to my child before taking my life?”<br />Loug Dana thought for a moment after hearing her plea and responded as follows.<br /><br />“Your soul is corrupt. However, a newly born soul is a different matter. It is not my task to lead uncorrupted souls to the Underworld. The reaping of your soul shall wait until you have given birth to your child.”<br />Thereafter, the princess gave birth to the king’s baby without incident. During childbirth, neither the mother nor the child showed any health problems. However, on the day after the baby’s birth, the princess died a mysterious and sudden death.<br />Given that legends speak of the princess’ life being taken according to the bargain she struck with the God of Death, it is easy to see that Loug Dana is by no means a benevolent entity.<br /><br />Yet, at the same time, it is also clear that the old legends do not paint the God of Death as an indiscriminate reaper of human life. Before the God of Death became widely known thanks to his summoned form by Melza, Loug Dana was regarded as an awe-inspiring god among the common folk.

	<h4>Scars of Terror</h4>
	<strong>Unlock at Lv10</strong>
	<br /><br />
	In past ages, Loug Dana was both feared and respected by the people, and several temples and altars built in his honor could be found in various places throughout Granzelia.<br /><br />Yet, because he had been summoned to the mortal realm by an infamous servant of the God of Ruin, the knight Melza, he became misunderstood among the common people as an entity which brings death and destruction to humankind.<br />During that time, some people who were not as familiar with the old legends are said to have held the mistaken impression that Loug Dana was an evil god and follower of Logseus, the God of Ruin.<br />For those who experienced the war, Melza and Loug Dana became a popular subject of fear and revulsion. As a result, after the end of the war with the God of Ruin, any remaining temples which enshrined Loug Dana were thoroughly destroyed at the hands of the general populace. Many valuable historical relics housed within were thus lost.<br />Even now, the God of Death, Loug Dana, is far from being correctly understood by the common folk and his tarnished reputation as an “evil god and enemy of humanity” has proven to have substantial staying power.<br /><br />However, some historians still tell the truth about Loug Dana and have launched various efforts to restore the god’s former temples and other places of worship. These scholars speculate that correctly understanding and offering reverence for Loug Dana may be a valuable stepping-stone for exploring the secrets of the Underworld, and even human life and death itself.
