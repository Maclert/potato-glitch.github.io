		<div class="panel-body"><p>Speaking of General Lanceveil... I still remember when the first draft of his profile was sent in.<br /><br />The head editor was so furious she glowered instead of cussing like she usually did. There were maybe twenty adults in the room and no one moved, no one even breathed.<br />Thanks to that incident, we spent several weeks poring over every line to make sure that the General's profile was as perfect as it could possibly be, before sending it in again.<br /><br />But between you and me, I think the head editor's just a really big fan of the General.<br /><br />– An outtake from an interview with a senior editor at the Aldana Daily offices.<br /><br />Haha… those were stressful times. We did Director Eliza and General Lanceveil’s profiles back to back, but because we were so exhausted after the Director’s profile we wrote up something that even a kid would shake his head at.<br /><br />Man, those days were fun. Hard work, lots of hard work, and you never know when someone or something’s about to blow up… but you know what, I’d do it all over again if I could.<br /><br />– A retired editor, when asked about the incident.</p></div>
