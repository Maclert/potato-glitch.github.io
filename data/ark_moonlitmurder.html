	<h4>The Moving Shadow</h4>
	<strong>Unlock at Lv2</strong>
	<br /><br />
	Historical records speak of many people hailing from other worlds who have settled in Granzelia.<br /><br />One such group who continues to stand out is a tribe known as the 'Shinobi' who have traditionally operated behind the scenes in a cross-national capacity. The Shinobi or, more colloquially, Ninjas are renowned for their ability to conduct clandestine activities, including assassinations, in the dark of night, with superhuman physical abilities and a mastery of various techniques that are often mistaken for actual magic. Additionally, Shinobi usually demand a high level of compensation for their services and their commitment to accomplishing their missions is accordingly intense.<br />Even today, there remains much that is uncertain regarding the Shinobi. However, Yashamaru, a well-known historical representative of the Shinobi, is said to have lived in the same world as the famous swordsman Shin.<br /><br />The swordsman Shin once spoke of the Shinobi as follows.<br />“They live by a different set of rules than me and the other warriors of this world. What is most remarkable about them is not their special techniques. Rather, it is the 'spiritual clarity' which they bring to the execution of their duties.”<br /><br />In Granzelia, the Shinobi are well-known for the active role they played in establishing a network of anti-God of Ruin forces among several nations immediately before the great war between humans and the God of Ruin.<br />At the time, the people, suffering under the tyranny and oppression of the God of Ruin formed clandestine rebel organizations in various locales. However, the watchful eye of the God of Ruin and his agents seldom slept and it was difficult to engage in large-scale activities or even establish reliable communication among different groups.<br /><br />The merchant Tarras, who was active in the port city of Granada, was one such member of an anti-God of Ruin organization who became concerned after he was unable to establish communications with his fellow dissidents for several days.<br />One night, as Tarras was about to fall asleep, he suddenly sensed a presence in his bedroom. Upon opening his eyes, he saw a strange man standing in the corner of his bedroom.<br />Just as Tarras was about to call for help, the man began to speak to Tarras with surprising cogency about the difficulties the latter faced in waging his rebellion and made the following proposal.<br /><br />“If you are able to pay my price, I can help you establish 'links' among the disparate anti-God of Ruin organizations scattered throughout the land.”<br /><br />Tarras was surprised at the sudden offer, but the man's words seemed to have a kind of gravity which made Tarras believe they were genuine. He therefore accepted the man's proposal, under the condition that payment would be made upon successful completion of the proposed task. The man thereafter took a letter written by Tarras and made his way to the closest dissident organization between returning with a reply one week later.<br />Upon returning, the man was covered in severe wounds and appeared to be on the brink of death, but he did not speak of his condition and simply handed over the letter he had received from the organization to Tarras. Thereafter, Tarras continued to exchange letters with various organizations established throughout Central Aldana with the help of the man.<br /><br />Naturally, the above operation remained entirely unknown to the agents of the God of Ruin. Ultimately, Tarras' efforts bore fruit and the people of Granzelia were able to make a stand against the God of Ruin, but it was not until the war was almost over that Tarras discovered that the man who had helped him establish links among the various clandestine organizations was in fact a Shinobi from another world.<br /><br />Other tales speak of many wealthy merchants and other men or substantial property throughout the land who resisted subjugation by the God of Ruin. It is said that at the time, the Shinobi foresaw the great turmoil to come as a result of the battle between the God of Ruin and humanity, so they sought areas where their unique skillset might be helpful, as well as employers capable of paying them suitable compensation for their efforts.<br /><br />It is also interesting to note that the proprietary communications network established at that time continued to survive for some time and was later used by Shinobi hired by the Holy Kingdom, Mordana Republic, and Kingdom of Lanzelia at the start of Aldana's war for world domination.

	<h4>Origins</h4>
	<strong>Unlock at Lv4</strong>
	<br /><br />
	The birthplace of those who call themselves Shinobi lies, of course, not in Granzelia, but a foreign world. Despite many questions still remaining regarding their formation and development even today, recent research has been able to gradually shed some light on the origins of the Shinobi.<br /><br />The emergence of the Shinobi in their world is said to have started with a special class of messengers who were responsible for maintaining communications among different regiments on the battlefield.<br />At that time, these messengers had not yet developed the special skills for which they later became known. Nor did they spend any significant time on the front lines of the battlefield, but rather served to coordinate among different regiments and they were thus often aggressively targeted by the enemy.<br />It was then that they gradually developed their own equipment and fighting style which combined mobility with power. Some who became particularly adept not only served as liaisons among regiments but were also tasked with intelligence operations and assassinations, and thereby developed their own unique set of martial arts.<br />Later, after the war reached its end and the world was largely at peace, they founded a secluded village where they could maintain their martial arts and other skills, and pass them down to future generations. There they further refined the techniques they had developed thus far, developing them into a unique school of martial arts distinct from those popular among ordinary soldiers and swordsmen.<br />When subsequent wars broke out, the Shinobi were known to sign agreements with the lords of various regions, to whom they lent their power.<br /><br />Interestingly, after founding their village, they also developed a kind of motto emblematic of their unique skills as they continued to hone their craft.<br />The motto translates roughly to “Carving Light Under The Moon”.<br />“Shinobi live not under the glow of the sun. Rather they exist under the light of the moon. Their skills are thus unveiled only in the moment they strike a killing blow, and never before.”<br />Thus have some scholars explained the martial philosophy of the Shinobi, as evidenced by the above motto.

	<h4>Schools</h4>
	<strong>Unlock at Lv7</strong>
	<br /><br />
	As the Shinobi began to operate as an independent power, they developed to the point where they were able to establish bases of operations in multiple locales. Eventually, each base started to develop its own techniques, rules and fighting styles, leading to the development of different Shinobi 'schools'.<br /><br />Initially, the different schools were able to coexist without any substantial infighting. However, as Shinobi belonging to different schools were forced to engage one another on the battlefield at the behest of their employers, friction, and eventually rivalries, developed. Ultimately, rival schools cut off relations with each other and the skills developed by each school were kept in strict confidence by their members, never to be revealed to outsiders.<br /><br />Typical examples of schools which developed out of the above process include the Gai and Go schools.<br />The Gai style is characterized by an emphasis on collective tactical action, demanding that at least three Shinobi work together in battle. Members of this school are famous for taking on and completing many particularly difficult missions.<br />On the other hand, the Go school emphasizes individual ability and skill sets rather than group efforts, and many masters and famous individuals have been reported to have emerged from this school.<br /><br />The above two schools, each extremely proud of their heritage and martial prowess, have been known to often clash violently in bloody struggle after bloody struggle. However, whenever the power of one of the two schools has waned significantly, the other school has always reduced its level of aggression and in some cases, has even joined forces with its rival to fight a common foe.<br /><br />In one particularly famous anecdote, the Gai and Go schools received orders from different employers. The Gai school had been tasked with “stealing a certain letter” while on the other hand, the Go school had been tasked with “protecting the same letter”.<br />The schools, having pledged to fulfil their respective employers' orders, sent forth their most agile and capable Shinobi. A fierce battle emerged over the letter in question. Finally, despite heavy losses, the Gai school succeeded in stealing the letter which it then sent to the lord responsible for the initial order.<br />However, unbeknownst to the two schools, both orders had been made with the objective of sowing conflict between the schools. The two employers observed the ensuing battle with amusement, curious as to which side should prevail.<br />When the above plot became known to the leaders of the Gai and Go schools, they immediately ceased fighting. It is claimed that, despite making no specific arrangements, the Gai school then went on to attack the Go school's employer while the Go school attacked the Gai school's employer, and neither rested until they had captured and beheaded the two lords responsible.

	<h4>The Exploits of Yashamaru</h4>
	<strong>Unlock at Lv10</strong>
	<br /><br />
	The first member of the Shinobi who really began to capture the popular imagination of the people of Granzelia is without question the individual known as Yashamaru, who played an active role in the great war waged against the God of Ruin.<br /><br />At that time, most of the Shinobi in Granzelia served only as liaisons and seldom appeared on the battlefield, but Yashamaru was different and could often be found at the front lines leveraging the esoteric techniques he learned as part of Shinobi training, to fight enemy soldiers.<br />Word of Yashamaru's exploits made their way from the warriors along whom he fought, to the common folk, and he quickly became a subject of popular fascination. However, warriors' accounts of Yashamaru tended to vary wildly, with some claiming to have seen him mow down enemy soldier while rising a giant frog, while others reported the famous Shinobi as having cut dozens of enemy soldiers to pieces, completely breaking their cohesion.<br />Such testimony is typically regarded as unreliable and likely the product of the overactive imaginations of soldiers rattled by the chaos of battle, but what is certain is that the mystery surrounding Yashamaru's existence has inspired many who came after him. After the end of the great war with the God of Ruin, many tales were spun with Yashamaru portrayed as a hero, and Granzelia experienced a (cultural) Shinobi Boom.<br /><br />One such tale relates the plight of mercenaries led by the famous warrior Evan, who were tasked with protecting the Arden Border. The band of mercenaries was heavily outclassed by the soldiers of the God of Ruin bearing down upon them, who were countless in number. Evan, doing what he could to help his comrades while engaging the enemy, was having trouble hiding his fatigue at what seemed like an endless battle.<br /><br />“Ugh... Perhaps this is the... end…"<br /><br />As he grunted in frustration, a whirlwind raged across the battlefield. When Evan looked closely at the whirlwind, he saw a man bearing a strange appearance.<br /><br />“Perhaps I can be of assistance…!"<br /><br />After speaking the above words, the man held his finger high up as if pointing towards the sky. Then, what appeared to be leaves flew up as though caught in a large whirlwind, before being transmuted into bright flame.<br />The God of Ruin's soldiers were helpless before the conflagration and cried out in despair as they were consumed by it. Evan, stunned by what had just transpired in front of him, called out to the man who had saved him and his fellow mercenaries.<br /><br />“B-By the gods, wh-who are you…?"<br /><br />“I am called Yashamaru. I have come to render aid.”<br /><br />Excerpted from “The Shinobi Whirlwind Chronicles: YASHAMARU.”<br /><br />“The Shinobi Whirlwind Chronicles: YASHAMARU” was written during the Shinobi Boom that followed Yashamaru's exploits in the Great War. Because the text was written more to entertain than to educate, it has been widely acclaimed by literary critics though generally panned by professional historians. For example, there is no record that the warrior Evan, known for his role in the battle of the Arden Border, ever met Yashamaru as described above.<br />Rather, recent research has shown that Yashamaru was in fact active in a different location at the time of the above battle and most historians are convinced that Yashamaru did not participate in the battle of the Arden Border.<br />Therefore, although the above record bears little value for historians, it was a big hit among children at the time, reaching a total of more than 20 volumes due to its popularity. <br />Yashamaru, who as a character was at once both mysterious due to his use of techniques outside the mainstream in Granzelia, as well as realistic for the active and verifiable role he played in history, captured the imagination of children around the world.
