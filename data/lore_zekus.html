	<h4>Youngest Warlord</h4>
	<strong>Unlock at Lv5</strong>
	<br /><br />
	Zekus was a student in the same year as Kyle in knight training. The two built a close, trusting relationship after a certain event during their schooling days. Zekus' parents were killed by beasts when he was young so he couldn't stand Rei when they first met, even if he couldn't deny his strength.<br /><br />After graduation Zekus got a job in administrative affairs, but he did so well that he ended up serving as tactician for the emperor's personal guard.<br /><br />The emperor has complete administrative, military, and judicial control of everything in the nation, but he generally entrusts these powers to the Imperial Council. The only forces he commands directly are the Imperial Guard and his personal guard. However, the Imperial Guard serves not only the emperor but the entire imperial family as well. Thus, since others can command the Imperial Guard, too, his personal guard is the only force that he really and truly commands as he pleases. The scale and scope of the emperor's personal guard have changed over the generations, at times being even more powerful than the Imperial Knights when the emperor wielded great power. The current emperor dislikes showing unnecessary displays of force and so his personal guard is the smallest it's ever been, composed only of elite forces.<br /><br />The tactician not only leads the personal guard but also offers his opinion on military affairs directly to the emperor.<br />Being the tactician of one small group of soldiers may not sound very impressive, but having access to the emperor's ear makes it an extremely powerful position, requiring not only knowledge but also strong character and a deep loyalty to the emperor.<br />Becoming the tactician at such a young age is a historical anomaly, and Zekus' appointment was roundly opposed despite having achieved great success in the “Battle to Seal the Blazing Dragon” in the vast deserts of Mordana.<br />He was only able to become tactician because crown prince Roland, who'd been in conflict with the emperor, finally acquiesced. He even went on to back Zekus to join the Council of Ten, which was also subsequently approved.<br />A year later Lily, the head researcher at the Arcance Laboratory, was promoted to the Council of Ten as well. Roland just so happened to have been pouring his effort into research at the laboratory, causing many to whisper that the emperor and crown prince had made some sort of behind-the-scenes bargain.<br /><br />Zekus himself ignored the opposition and rumors, quietly advising the emperor and resolving a number of complicated issues to earn recognition and respect for his new role.

	Before Zekus began working in the imperial administration he served as a page to the emperor. Through this he learned about many fields of knowledge from the emperor's other assistants. His thirst for learning was insatiable and he absorbed the things he heard with incredible speed.<br /><br />Noticing this the emperor suggested he enter knight training in order to further his education, and Zekus agreed. There he met Kyle, who he thought poorly of at first for hanging out with a beast like Rei.<br />It was Zekus' nature to keep a distance from others, so the two didn't have many opportunities to interact until an incident occurred while students were gathering a special plant specimen in the Gragia Mountains.<br /><br />Zekus knew all about the mountains' geography and was able to locate the desired plant faster than anyone else in the class. It was growing on the side of a cliff, so most students were too scared to get close enough to pick it. But Zekus, more physically fit than the average student, had no problem climbing and scaling the cliff to reach the plant.<br /><br />However, on his way back he was attacked by an Elbird. Calmly he attempted to use magic to fend it off, but then suddenly one student leapt off the cliff onto the bird to land an attack. The student plummeted to the ground together with the Elbird and sustained numerous injuries, but at least succeeded in defeating the beast.<br />The student then turned to Zekus and asked, "Hey, you okay?"<br /><br />Zekus realized it was Kyle, to whom he was normally quite cold, and for some reason grew angry. Feeling harsher than usual, he said, "There was no reason for you to do that. I didn't need your help. Were you trying to put me in your debt, is that it?"<br />"I saw you were being attacked so I jumped, that's all," replied Kyle. With a laugh he added, "Whatever! I'm just glad you're safe."<br /><br />Zekus threw the plants he'd just collected in Kyle's face, making Kyle shout, "What the hell are these?"<br />That made Zekus burst out laughing, and ever since then they've had a blunt and honest friendship.<br /><br />Zekus often takes a more harsh attitude towards Rei, however. The only reason Kyle doesn't take him to task over it is this personal history of theirs.

	<h4>A Child In the Slums</h4>
	<strong>Unlock at Lv50</strong>
	<br /><br />
	People's personality and values are formed by the environment and people they spend time around over the course of their lives.<br />Indeed, much of Zekus' thinking and behavior was influenced by things he personally experienced.<br /><br />Born an orphan he was raised in slums on the outskirts of the capital. Though he emanates a controlled, intellectual air nowadays, he was famous for getting into trouble when he was younger.<br /><br />He fought with other kids almost everyday back then, even if you'd never guess it from the way he is now. However, this was an inevitable part of surviving life in the slums for him.<br />Robberies were a regular occurrence where Zekus lived, but he had no one to protect him. Outsmarting others was the only way he knew to protect himself.<br /><br />Furthermore, the slums were populated by many beasts in addition to humans. The empire believed beasts were meant to serve humans, forcing especially gifted beasts to work behind the scenes rather than in public. Many children were terrified by the idea that beasts were far more powerful than humans. And it wasn't just Zekus but also other children in the slums who experienced violence unfairly at the hands of beasts. Adults on friendly terms with beasts seemed like villains consorting with the enemy.<br /><br />This is ostensibly why Zekus felt so negatively towards Rei, but his friends say there were other, unspoken reasons as well.<br /><br />Then one day the emperor decided to visit and inspect the slums after reconsidering his views on beasts.<br />There he came across two groups fighting each other. One side was a mix of humans and beasts; the other was a bunch of young boys. The adults and beasts naturally seemed to possess the upper hand at first glance. However, the children were somehow able to perceive the other side's weakness and slowly but steadily pick them off. Once their enemies' numbers had dwindled, they called out older, stronger boys who'd been hiding int he sidelines, and finally managed to emerge victorious.<br /><br />As he watched the emperor realized that one boy in particular was the one in charge. It was young Zekus. The emperor proposed he serve him in the capital, but in response Zekus only hurled curses. The emperor's aides were outraged, but he sent them away and then struck a bargain with Zekus. In exchange for agreeing to work for him, the emperor would support Zekus' friends in the slums with everything they needed. Zekus' response this time was much less foul-mouthed, and he acquiesced to the emperor's proposal.

	<h4>A Gift</h4>

	<br /><br />
	When Zekus first started working for the emperor he shut himself off from everyone around him. His upbringing had been so cruel that he'd learned never to trust anyone.<br />The emperor hoped to change Zekus' aggressive stance through not only an outpouring of wisdom and knowledge but also by filling his heart with warmth.<br />The emperor made a point to schedule in time to spend together. During these moments he would sometimes share his own past experiences, and other times let Zekus tell his story, to which the emperor always listened as intently as circumstances would allow.<br /><br />Zekus didn't take the emperor seriously at first, but through these sessions he gradually began to open up more about his thoughts and feelings. Soon their time together became an invaluable part of Zekus' life, enabling him to experience human warmth for the first time in his life.<br /><br />As a result he began to interact more with the talented people surrounding the emperor and thus learned many things.<br />This not only boosted his general knowledge but also his understanding of formal behavior and manners. The small anxieties and struggles he faced in the process of talking to people of so many different backgrounds and personalities was educational in and of itself, too. Some things never change, though. The emperor could only smile wryly while watching people try to get on Zekus' good side but saying all the wrong things.<br /><br />There are various theories and hypotheses about why the emperor went so far out of his way to act on Zekus behalf. Most conclude that it was a calculated move rather than an act of pure kindness, possibly a bargaining chip with the disagreeable crown prince in order to instill hope amongst people in the slums. Beyond political explanations, some say the two had a physical relationship as well, and all manner of other theories.<br /><br />In any case Zekus ignored the rumors, and of course the emperor did, too. No matter his reasons, it was a fact that Zekus had received many things from the emperor both tangible and intangible. Though he rarely said so aloud, he was deeply grateful. No one who knew the two could deny that Zekus showed a strong sense of loyalty and worked every day to advance the emperor's cause.
