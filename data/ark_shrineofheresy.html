	<h4>Island of Heretics</h4>
	<strong>Unlock at Lv2</strong>
	<br /><br />
	Lueba Island, located across from Mordana Harbor, is an uninhabited, barren land where no crops can be grown.<br />However, the island was once home to a community of around 300 people.<br /><br />This community existed prior to the war with the God of Ruin.<br />During this era, a suspiciously dressed man had begun wandering around Port Odal. He revered a peculiar god known as Elboa, and soon started preaching in the streets. He demonstrated various supernatural phenomena which he called “Divine Miracles” in front of the people.<br />Word spread, and he quickly gained followers. In less than half a year, the Church of Elboa was formed.<br /><br />The church steadily gained followers after that, but as it attracted the eyes of the people, it naturally attracted the eyes of the Kingdom of Mordana as well. Seeking to prevent chaos, the nation prepared to crack down on the church and its founder. However, the founder sensed the crackdown was coming, and escaped to Lueba Island with his followers in tow.<br />He then remodeled the island’s mountain cave into a temple where the church could worship its god. In their new headquarters, they performed their peculiar rites.

	<h4>Cult Ritual</h4>
	<strong>Unlock at Lv4</strong>
	<br /><br />
	The founder worshipped the god Elboa, but to this very day, not a single shred of literature or folklore about this supposed god has been confirmed, and it is doubtful this god even exists.<br />The supernatural phenomena demonstrated by the founder that he called “Divine Miracles” are believed by every researcher on the topic to be nothing more than simple magic embellished with acting and cunning words.<br /><br />After being driven to Lueba Island, the Church of Elboa performed their strange rites every night in their new temple. The rites were several times more suspicious and intense than what they had performed back in Mordana Harbor.<br />At the heart of these was a ceremony where they would burn hallucinogenic plants and dance while in a trance. Amid the chaos, they would lift up their prayers to the god Elboa.<br />In another rite, they would periodically collect the blood of the believers into a large grail and offer it to the altar of their god.<br />An even stranger rite was the ritualistic slaughter of livestock before the altar; they would thereafter put the remains on display and let it naturally rot until only a skeleton remained.<br /><br />It is still unclear exactly what significance these bizarre rites were supposed to have. In any case, it is probably safe to assume that the believers’ faith in the god Elboa was simply that strong.

	<h4>Tragedy at Port Odal</h4>
	<strong>Unlock at Lv7</strong>
	<br /><br />
	Once the church’s activities on Lueba Island had reached equilibrium, the founder swept across the continent of Mordana once more, searching for more followers in order to spread his influence. However, the Kingdom of Mordana had been keeping a watchful eye on the church’s activities and so had foreseen his movement.<br />The very moment he landed at Port Odal, he was arrested, charged with treason, and taken elsewhere.<br />Upon learning that their founder had been taken away, the enraged followers embarked for Mordana Harbor to take him back; once there, they clashed with the guards who had been waiting for them. However, the followers were amateurs in combat and had no chance of success against the guards.<br />The battle leaned heavily on the guards’ side, but the cult’s followers did not fear death and refused to surrender.<br />Every last follower either died in the skirmish or by committing suicide. The bizarre conflict shook the guards despite their overwhelming victory. Thus, the tragedy was forever etched into the history of Mordana Harbor.<br /><br />After losing the majority of its supporters, the Church of Elboa’s influence gradually dwindled until it was extinguished. The majority of the remaining followers had abandoned the church and returned home. While a devout few remained on the island to continue their faith, there was no longer an organized church for them to operate within.<br /><br />Interestingly, there is no remaining record of what happened to the founder afterward.<br />One theory posits that the founder was executed in secret so as to not incite a revolt from his followers.<br />Another states that his influence and charisma earned him a position in the Kingdom of Mordana under a different name.<br />To this day, however, not a single theory has been backed by enough proof to gain mainstream approval.

	<h4>Vestiges of Madness</h4>
	<strong>Unlock at Lv10</strong>
	<br /><br />
	After the riot in Mordana Harbor, the Temple of Elboa on Lueba Island fell to ruin, and it became a den for boorish Beasts and sinister spirits.<br />It was originally a place to summon those sort of beings, but whether or not they had come there as a direct result of the followers’ mad rituals is unknown. Not even the few followers who remained on the island dared approach the temple. Eventually, however, a lone man did just that, and he took “something” back with him.<br />It is unknown exactly what the man took from the temple, but he was later identified as the infamous sorcerer Magra who had performed many nefarious experiments.<br />It’s commonly believed that Magra took interest in the church due to the magic the founder had used. Others have suggested that Magra was the one who taught the founder his magic in the first place, and had been absorbing the followers’ devotion with a certain magical artifact.<br /><br />Whatever the case, there is no doubt that whatever Magra took from the temple, he would later use in his repulsive magical experiments.
