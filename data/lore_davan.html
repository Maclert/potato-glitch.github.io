	<h4>Hero of the Empire</h4>
	<strong>Unlock at Lv10</strong>
	<br /><br />
	Captain of the Twelfth Order of Imperial Knights of the Aldana Empire.<br />Davan is hailed as a hero both inside the Empire and out.<br /><br />Even within the Empire, he’s known as a brave warrior who’s faced countless battles. While his position falls short of those of the Council of Ten, he’s nonetheless become representative of the Imperial Knights by virtue of his accomplishments and abilities. Not only that, but many of the citizens recognize his face sooner than anyone from the Council.<br />He’s also particularly popular amongst the knights themselves, the most fervent of whom have even gone as far as making and distributing T-shirts bearing his name.<br />Whether he’s like a celebrity or a father figure to them is unknown.<br /><br />Having quickly become interested in skyships and their mobility, Davan conscripted the most advanced skyship the empire had to offer. As a result, the order of knights under his command have an additional role as a skyship unit. They fly freely around Granzelia, demonstrating the military might of the empire against wicked magical beasts in every region.<br />This set of skills has led many to insist that he’s deserving of a much higher position than captain of any one order. Regardless, Davan would rather find himself out in the field than remain in the capital for extended stays.<br /><br />His old acquaintances, Imperial Guard Division Commander Granadas, and Adventurer’s Guild guildmaster Beyland, had this to say about his propensity to be out in the field.<br /><br />“Hmph,” said Granadas, “it certainly would make my life easier if he took a desk job, but he’s just not the kind to stay tied down in the Capital’s walls, so what can you do?”<br /><br />“Davan always seems to be in the right place at the right time,” said Beyland, “and gets the job done above and beyond expectations. He does this to a fault, I might add. He shines on the front lines. Though, that’s just the kind of man he is.”<br /><br />On the other hand, Davan’s politics lean loyal to the Emperor, and he doesn’t have the best relationship with the Imperial Army Commander and Crowned Prince, Roland. This is rumored to be the reason behind his disinterest in a higher position, and why he doesn’t stay long in the Capital.

	Davan is now a paragon of the Imperial Knights, but he was naught but an ordinary soldier when he first joined the Aldana Imperial Army.<br />He’s originally from an impoverished home and came to the capital as a child with his father, who was seeking employment. However, his father had a difficult time finding stable employment, and amidst financial troubles fell ill and passed away.<br />Davan, who was seventeen at the time, enlisted in the Imperial Army in order to stave off starvation.<br /><br />Davan’s first role within the army was guarding the port. His prowess in battle, however, was head and shoulders above the rest. He made a name for himself by single-handedly taking down a pack of hostile marine beasts.<br />The captain of the guard recognized his abilities and thought it a waste for Davan to spend the rest of his days as a regular soldier. Thus, he gave him a special recommendation to the Knight Academy.<br />Davan was able to attend the academy with the captain’s aid, and there he met a person who would become a one-of-a-kind friend.<br /><br />Before long, Davan officially became a knight and was assigned to the Twelfth Order of Imperial Knights. The captain of this order was none other than Davan’s former captain at the port.<br />Davan continued to build upon his achievements under the leadership of the man who first acknowledged his strength. Meanwhile, aside from his duties as an Imperial Knight, he and his friend took to exploring old ruins and adventuring.<br />Incidentally, it was during this time that he became acquainted with the Adventurer’s Guild guildmaster Beyland. This is attributed to these private activities.<br /><br />In time, Davan’s boss and benefactor, the captain of the Twelfth Order, retired, and Davan was nominated as his successor. The captain retired after receiving a grievous wound from a battle with a fearsome beast. Davan was far away during this battle, tending to a mission of his own. To this day, he carries a deep regret for not being at his captain’s side.<br />Davan rose to become captain of the Twelfth Order. Meanwhile, his one-of-a-kind friend left the Imperial Knights. In order to be a better example for his troops, he reformed his ways bit by bit.

	<h4>Foe becomes Friend</h4>

	Davan became captain of the Twelfth Order of Imperial knights. He flew all across Granzelia on his skyship, enacting great deeds, all the while gaining a name for himself within the Imperial Army. Among the feats that brought him fame, one stands out above all: the battle to defend Port Town Granada.<br /><br />One day, Granada was accosted by a gigantic bear-like magical beast. Davan was alerted and flew straight to the scene. He fought alongside the town’s guard and managed to quell the raging beast. Then, just as he was about to bring his trusty battle axe down upon the beast, he was beseeched by its very victims, the soldiers of Granada, to spare its life.<br />According to them, the beast was once a guardian spirit of sorts in the region. It was said to help soldiers and travelers who got lost in the Malboria Caverns.<br />Davan had his doubts about the reality of the situation, so he decided to ask the beast directly.<br /><br />“I’m aware that not every magical beast is out there attacking people. Your actions made you out to be something of a guardian spirit around these parts. Why, then, do you attack the people of Granada?”<br /><br />The magical beast answered Davan’s question by retelling what befell it. Like the soldiers had said, the beast was not the kind to attack men, instead going as far as helping those who stumbled into its territory.<br />However, about half a year prior, it was bested by a group of sorcerers who attacked it without warning. They cursed it, and since that time it’s been accosted by an urge to destroy.<br />There’s a miraculous medicine somewhere in Lanzelia that may lift the curse, but the beast could never hope to find it in its present state.<br />It sought death before it was again taken over by destructive urges. So it asked of Davan a merciful end, to which Davan gave his answer.<br /><br />“Hmph. You think I’m about to kill you after all the people you’ve helped? The very people of Granada have asked me to save you. You just hold on here.”<br /><br />He proceeded to hop on his skyship and fly off, returning several hours later, miracle medicine in hand.<br />The medicine did its work and the beast, now back to its senses, thanked Davan.<br />They say that the beast went back to its home in the mountains and continued to help wayward travelers.<br /><br />Davan was derided by anti-magical beast factions for aiding a magical beast, and there were even those who held that he should resign as Knight Captain. However, Prince Roland, a strong proponent of said factions, somehow spared him a fierce punishment, letting him off with but a brief suspension.<br />These measures sent waves across the Imperial Army. However, one theory posits that the sorcerers who cursed the bear-like magical beast were under Roland’s banner. Rumor has it he feared exacerbating the situation and triggering an investigation that might uncover the truth.<br /><br />Whatever the case, Davan’s reputation skyrocketed with this event. Soldiers who learned of it praised him as “the warlord who would save not only his allies but his very enemies as well.”

	<h4>That's it to the Story</h4>

	Unfortunately, there is no account in the Aldana Empire’s records regarding where Davan went or what he did during the bear-like magical beast incident. However, Blaze’s records shine a light on his course of action.<br /><br />As for where he went, the place was Blaze Garden.<br />The following is an excerpt from the memoirs of Dilmordo, a warrior guarding Blaze at the time.<br /><br />“We received a report that a skyship of the Aldana Empire had breached our airspace. It’s put everyone on edge; I suppose that’s to be expected. Blaze’s military might has been growing, but we certainly don’t have the manpower to gain victory against the global empire that is Aldana.<br />At once, I ordered the men to get on emergency alert and to scout the perimeter. It was then that that man appeared, alone. He identified himself as Davan and stood before us unarmed. He said he was a knight of Aldana.<br /><br />“Please hear me out,” he continued.<br /><br />Upon being confronted by a man from Aldana, my men were itching to go in for the kill, but I kept them at bay. The man knew he was in the headquarters of an opposing organization. And yet he came before us unarmed and alone. It proved he had an unusual determination and, undoubtedly, a likewise goal.<br />I had my men step back so I might hear his story directly. By his account, a bear-like beast was being tormented by a curse and he sought a medicine to cure it.<br />I could tell from the look in his eyes that this story was no fabrication. Indeed, we did have said medicine in Blaze, and it was within my power to give it to him. I also had no reason to refuse to aid to a beast in suffering, however faraway.<br /><br />Yet, there was something on my mind, something I would ask him before handing over the medicine.<br /><br />“Why are you, Imperial scum, going so far to help a beast?” I asked.<br /><br />To which the man replied, “That beast asked me to kill it. Whether beast or man, I can’t kill someone like that. I would refuse to do so, at least. So I’ve no choice but to help it. That’s all there is to it.”<br /><br />Strangely enough, that answer was enough to convince me. I entrusted him with the medicine.<br /><br />He took it and said simply, “Sorry for causing a commotion.” He then went on his way.<br /><br />He likely went straight to his ship. I had never thought much of the Aldana Empire. Granted, they are the nation in control of Granzelia at this point in time. Blaze would have little hope of victory should we fight them head on. Yet, a government built on prejudice and persecuting beasts is bound to come apart at the seams and create an opportunity for defeat.<br /><br />Regardless, they can’t be underestimated if they have knights like him in their ranks. In time, we may have to face the Empire in battle.<br />We must be well prepared.”
