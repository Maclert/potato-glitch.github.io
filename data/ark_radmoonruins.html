	<h4>Magic's True Meaning</h4>
	<strong>Unlock at Lv2</strong>
	<br /><br />
	Long ago, there existed something called the “True Sorcery”, which stood at the very peak of magical skill.<br />It was said to be a power that would awaken when those who had mastered various magical arts came together and concentrated their powers. However, such highly skilled practitioners were few and far between, never converging at one point in time, and the legend gradually faded from memory.<br /><br />The years passed by until, in the age when the God of Ruin ruled the world, three of the most powerful sorcerers came together to seek the True Sorcery:<br />Dyne, the so-called father of civilization and wielder of fire.<br />Kanon, who controlled the power of thunder.<br />And one other sorcerer, who manipulated the power of ice.<br />The name of the one with mastery over ice has been lost to us, but it is certain that there were three.<br /><br />They worked together in the Holy Odal Kingdom, although their exact base of activities is unknown.<br />It is hard to get a handle on the details as they moved about frequently, but the biggest reason for the lack of information is that they operated on another level than the regular citizens of Odal and had few points of contact with them.<br />Even those who shun interactions with others tend not to be entirely isolated, but these sorcerers had absolutely no contact with anyone outside of their trio.<br />It is unclear how they procured life’s necessities under these circumstances, but it seems they were able to respond to their environment and maintain their detached lifestyle without issue.<br /><br />According to those who watched them from afar, they were extremely knowledgeable about nature and civilization, and their ability to adapt to the constantly changing events around them further showcased their extraordinary talents.<br />In reverence of their superior wisdom and magical power, people at the time gave them the title of the Three Sages.

	<h4>An Obstacle to Sorcery</h4>
	<strong>Unlock at Lv4</strong>
	<br /><br />
	It seems that the appearance and subsequent acknowledgment of the Three Sages in the Holy Odal Kingdom was a sudden event.<br />One day, one of the many ancient ruins dotted around the kingdom abruptly emitted a burst of intense magical energy, and a knight who was on patrol nearby hurried to investigate. The knight, on guard for the appearance of anyone who could threaten the kingdom, was attempting to identify what was behind the power surge when the Three Sages appeared from within the ruins.<br />This is the first historical record of their existence.<br /><br />The Three Sages did not display any of the antagonism toward the nation that the knight had been on the alert for. In fact, they seemed to have little interest not only in the kingdom, but in the world at large.<br />So just what were they interested in?<br />We can surmise that their concerns were directed entirely toward the pursuit of True Sorcery and their accompanying research, which they had been conducting in the ruins.<br />There are theories that the huge burst of magical power had been generated in the course of that research. Perhaps the ruins provided an environment where it was especially easy to enhance magical energy, and so served as the perfect test site for them.<br /><br />The God of Ruin did not take kindly to the existence of the Three Sages and their unfamiliar magic, and had its followers surround the site and invade from the mountains, the plains, and the sea.<br />The Three Sages fought alone against the seemingly unbeatably powerful forces of its followers, both human and Beast.<br />One stopped the enemy in their tracks with the power of ice, while another brought down lightning upon the frozen forces. Those who made it through were burned to ashes by the third.<br />In the face of the Three Sages’ coordinated attacks, the god’s followers could do nothing but turn tail and flee in defeat.

	<h4>Yearning for Immortality</h4>
	<strong>Unlock at Lv7</strong>
	<br /><br />
	Even after the God of Ruin’s initial forces were met with defeat, it continued to order attacks against the Three Sages.<br />They obliterated anyone who sought to interfere with them, no matter who or what they were. Although not intentional, in the process it seems they saved both humans and Beasts from the God of Ruin’s followers. Perhaps the God of Ruin resented them for pursuing the True Sorcery outside of its sphere of influence, and wished to prevent them from achieving their goal.<br /><br />There are other tales left to us from the war between the Three Sages and the God of Ruin.<br />The sorcerers continued their research into the True Sorcery, even as they battled against those who tried to interfere. However, they began to realize that their remaining lifespan was not long enough to fulfil their goal of attaining the True Sorcery.<br />Thus, they began to search for a way in which to make their fleshly bodies immortal through the use of magic.<br />In their investigations, they learned that the materials necessary for achieving this were to be found on the Odal continent. There were three such materials: Magic Crystals from the Mines of Gord; Gold Dust from the Badar Sea of Trees; and Duckweed from the Poison Swamp.<br /><br />The Three Sages set out to procure these materials, but the God of Ruin, unwilling to let them achieve immortality, used its followers to try and obstruct their path.<br />While dealing with these followers, they managed to acquire the gems and the gold dust, but the God of Ruin got to the Poison Swamp before them and plucked all the Duckweed.<br />Unable to gather all the required ingredients, their attempt to master bodily immortality ended in failure. This is when they shifted direction to the idea of prolonging their existences not through the vessel, but of what was contained inside it – making their souls immortal.<br />In other words, they would discard their deteriorating bodies while keeping their minds, and the knowledge and magical skill they had cultivated therein, tethered to this world.

	<h4>Soul Succession</h4>
	<strong>Unlock at Lv10</strong>
	<br /><br />
	In order to grant their souls immortality, the Three Sages created an “Insignia of Radmoon” in the ruins out of three walls and three gems, and sealed their knowledge and power into each gem.<br />These gems could be described as the crystallization of the Three Sages’ desire that someday, one worthy of following in their footsteps and carrying out their last wishes would appear.<br /><br />It is said that the souls of the Sages within these walls would be bestowed upon whoever unseals the gems.<br />To unseal them, one must correctly align the gems and the walls; deciphering the combination would require considerable knowledge and skill.<br />It is an abstruse method of succession indeed.<br />Has anyone actually managed to inherit their souls? The answer to that question can be found within existing records.<br /><br />The title of the Three Sages continues to appear in texts spanning hundreds of years, which is proof that the succession of souls has been achieved via the power of the Insignia. However, the Insignia merely passes on the souls, so it is somewhat unnatural that the name would crop up over centuries, as though the Three Sages themselves lived on.<br />We can surmise that the name itself is being passed on too, and that those who inherit the power of the Insignia continue to use it as a sign of respect toward the original Three Sages.<br /><br />The succession of souls via the Insignia can theoretically continue on for all eternity. However, without a container to hold the soul – in other words, a body – the line of succession will be broken.<br />The fact that there is currently no one bearing the name of the Three Sages may mean that the gems are currently lying dormant in the ruins the original Sages once occupied, awaiting the appearance of a new vessel to carry them.
