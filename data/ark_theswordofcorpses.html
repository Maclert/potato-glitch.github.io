	<h4>The Rescued Child</h4>
	<strong>Unlock at Lv2</strong>
	<br /><br />
	Humanity has proved victorious in its war against the God of Ruin, whose forces were decimated in the conflict. Because of this, it’s now possible to search their abandoned bases for documents of historic value. Below is one example, the story of a fearsome human berserker who joined the divine forces, as related by a devotee of Lougseus.<hr />Today, we’ve destroyed another human village as a divine punishment for their defiance of the almighty Lougseus. What preposterous, arrogant beings they are to oppose us despite their incompetence. Had they given up their irrational hopes and followed in silence, they wouldn’t have needed to suffer. Foolish indeed.<br /><br />However, we’ve obtained an unexpected gain from this silly village: a human child. He had very intriguing eyes, ones that glimmered with raw hatred while watching the villagers’ execution. The child wasn’t staring at us, but at his fellow villagers instead. Apparently, this individual is an orphan outsider brutalized by the villagers on a daily basis. The owner of such glowing eyes might just be the “useful tool” we need.

	Apparently the devotee of Lougseus started training the child villager to become his personal warrior. And although there was some precedent, it was still rare to see a follower of the God of Ruin retaining a human servant at the time. Judging from his writings, this devotee despised humans while also praising their strength and combativeness.<hr />Though my brethren ridiculed me when they learned I took in a human child, that was to be expected. Raising a human would seem abusrd to any normal mind, but that only goes to show the limits of a normal mind.<br /><br />Certainly, the majority of humans are useless weaklings, but once every so often there will be a few individuals with exceptional powers. It only makes sense that I put those powers to good use. That’s why I started training the child, and his noteworthy performance has not let me down. His talented swordplay and love of battle are noteworthy indeed.<br /><br />“You did well. I have high expectations for you.”<br /><br />My words seemed to encourage him greatly. Humans are so easily manipulated… but the experience has been agreeable to me. I’m confident that I can raise him to become a splendid warrior.<br /><br />That being so, I am concerned about the threat that the humans pose to our dominance. They are growing ever more defiant, but we can naturally not allow any insurrection from the likes of them. They deserve to be massacred at the first signs of rebellion. However, ruling isn’t exclusively about shows of power. By giving the humans a small amount of freedom, we can prevent many greater problems. I only wish that some of my kin would understand…<br /><br />If the humans band together and rebel, we would suffer a great loss. After all, a battle with the humans will cause us to lose many of our “cattle”.

	The notebook featured a number of anecdotes on the war between humanity and Lougseus. Much has been written on the war from humanity’s perspective, but this record is exceptional for being authored by a follower of the God of Ruin. The writer sent his young protege to the battlefield, and he seemed very pleased about the resulting military achievements.<hr />It is now without doubt that the humans are determined to defy us. What ungrateful beings they are to dismiss the benevolence of the almighty Lougseus, who has granted the privilege to live. It’s absolutely intolerable. The rebels must be devastated so that they never consider such insolence again. Losing a large number of “cattle” is certainly a pity, but in this case there’s little choice.<br /><br />I called out for the human I had raised and said to him, “Prove your worth.”<br />The child – who had already grown to be a young man – nodded, and his eyes glimmered with joy. Before he set out, I handed him a cursed blade, which consumes the wielder’s soul to convert it into destructive power. It was the perfect weapon for my protege.<br /><br />Before long word of his achievements in battle reached me, and they were pleasing. I’ve heard stories of him standing atop a hill of the dead, striking terror into the humans with the frenzied swing of his blade.<br /><br />They call him “The Sword of Corpses”?<br />What a fitting nickname for my underling.

	Unbelievable… How could the wretched humans ever manage to seal away the almighty Lougseus? No, this couldn’t be their doing alone. Some separate forces – some other forces – must have taken advantage of the war. What other explanation is possible!?<br /><br />Though it pains me to admit, the humans gained the upper hand in Granzelia once the God of Ruin was out of their way. They lay siege to my castle, and though their bodies were inferior, their numbers were clearly superior – leaving me little choice but to consider retreat.<br /><br />At that moment, the young man I raised approached me and broke his typical silence. He told me I need not worry, because he would protect me.<br />“The likes of a human protecting ME? How impudent – you were just an idle amusement to me, and now your role is finished. Return to your ilk!”<br /><br />Hearing my words, he flashed a subtle grin and then left. I never saw him again. But soon afterward, I managed to escape the castle and retreat to my current base. Only later did I learn that immediately after leaving, the young man set upon the humans and sparked the savage battle that bought me the time to flee.<br /><br />To me, the young man was never anything more than a pet or toy; still, even today I cannot forget the expression on his face. If only I could somehow articulate the emotion he evoked within me…<hr />The writing in the notebook ends here, and as such we can only speculate what happened to the devotee of the God of Ruin. Perhaps he was struck down, or perhaps he found his way back to his brethren. All that can be said for sure is that no trace of him would survive the tumult of that great war.<br /><br />Today, this notebook is the only proof he ever existed – apart, of course, for the berserk warrior he raised: the one we know as “Ars, the Black Sword.”
