	<h4>Beast in Human Form</h4>
	<strong>Unlock at Lv2</strong>
	<br /><br />
	Loug Mekia are said to have a peculiar existence amongst the Lougsean forces, as they hardly appear before humans. Of course, despite their sparse appearances the awareness for their existence is nowhere near that low.<br />This is because they were always there during key points leading to and during the war. They were the catalysts of the conflict, causing chaos and mayhem amongst beasts and mankind alike. Suitably, this earned Loug Mekias their formidable reputation.<br /><br />The true nature of these beasts, if one were to call them such, is still unknown. Loug Mekia is said to be a twisted amalgamation of both man and beast. A combination put together in a distorted and nightmarish way.<br />It is said that the Lougsean forces are much more heartless than the average human or beast, yet they have all been able to show some minuscule form of emotion. From the presumably humanoid Four Deities, to the Loug Mez, to anyone and anything that swore alliance. Yet, not even the expression of pain can be seen on the Loug Mekia. It is like an emotionless, unflinching machine.<br />It only appears before the larger threats that oppose the God of Ruin. From this, it is speculated that Loug Mekia have a special connection to the said god, transcending mortal kind.

	<h4>Start of a Nightmare</h4>

	The first mention of Loug Mekia in any form of literature comes from a time before the reign of the God of Ruin.<br /><br />According to those reports, Loug Mekia appeared in a large city that worshipped Lagudell, attacking any citizen that came near.<br />Of course, the city fought back against this monstrosity. Amongst the soldiers was Owen, the soaring swordsman, who was known for cutting through the skies to repel other gods. Eventually confronting Loug Mekia, Owen put all of his strength into a single blow. Though, his battlecry was cut short and he was the one that was falling. The citizens could only watch in a shocked silence as their hero and hopes had plummeted to the ground.<br /><br />With their hero hardly able to put up a fight, the civilians and even the soldiers silently came to terms with the idea of surrendering. Yet while the civilians cowered, Loug Mekia spoke to them in that terrifying, echoey, ethereal tone.<br /><br />“With your own hands, kill the one that attacked me. Do so and I will spare your lives.”<br /><br />The citizens were perplexed, looking at one another and then to their fallen hero. Slowly, some started to take up arms and approach the fallen hero. Owen had scrambled to his feet, but he was surrounded by the despair-stricken civilians. Their hollow stares baring their collective anguish. Not wanting to harm the innocents, Owen soon found himself in a corner. His screams fell on deaf ears. If Owen didn’t die, it was their lives on the line.<br />As they closed in on him, lightning struck down, felling anyone that came too close to him.<br /><br />The citizens and Owen were puzzled, as the lightning was summoned by the Loug Mekia.<br /><br />That voice reverberated through the town again.<br />“This is a gift of life from my lord. Your newfound role is to spread the majesty of our god to the mortal and ignorant humans. Humbly accept your role.”<br /><br />Since then, that city had been cleanly wiped off the map.<br />Owen, the sole survivor, lived on to preach of the terrors of the God of Ruin. Going through his says, living in intense fear of Loug Mekia. In the span of a year, the once proud hero had become the equivalent of a mumbling hermit, living his days in the fear of the shadow of the Divine Beast.

	<h4>Divine Beast</h4>
	<strong>Unlock at Lv7</strong>
	<br /><br />
	In modern-day Granzelia, the term “Divine Beast” had become another one of Loug Mekia’s collective titles.<br />Divine Beasts are said to be created by the gods, a kindred existence of sorts. The main role that was given to Loug Mekia was to command over the other followers and to communicate as a messenger, delivering orders that came from the gods to said followers. Of course, their roles are said to vary from god to god. But because most of them had been created by the God of Ruin, the reasons they were born into this world are still unclear. Perhaps destruction, perhaps just to keep forces organized.<br /><br />One story that had been passed down was of the goddess Meluc, who existed long before the tyrannical rule of ruin.<br />Meluc was a rather negligent goddess, seemingly forgetting whatever duties she had in the lower world and instead, making a beast that would do those responsibilities in her place. The Divine Beast adhered to Meluc’s commands and fulfilled whatever duties were thrust upon them. Although, their ability was so great, the Divine Beast was often mistaken as a god by the mortals.<br />This angered Meluc, forcing her to order the Divine Beast to maltreat mankind in attempts to make them worship her again. As the slaughter of innocents went on, people scrambled to the temples they had previously built in Meluc’s honor. Meluc had given protection to the ones that came to the neglected and dusty shrines. She gave them refuge, as the nightmarish monster causing mayhem was under her command. As the people returned to the goddess’ sanctuaries, the commotion coming down from the Divine Beast faded, as if Meluc had struck down the terror.<br /><br />This story had been passed down, yet only one creature had fit the description of Loug Mekia quite accurately.<br />Of course, the description was merely, “a silhouette of what appeared to be half-beast and half-man.”<br />Information was scarce, leaving the possibility that it wasn’t Loug Mekia, as there had been rumors of another creature fitting that description at the same time. Because of this mishap, hardly any of the troops from Lougseus’ army know of Loug Mekia’s existence.

	<h4>And the Four Deities</h4>
	<strong>Unlock at Lv10</strong>
	<br /><br />
	It is said that Loug Mekia, along with each of the Lords of Ruin, have the power to turn the tides of battle. Because of this, they are not often seen cooperating on the battlefield.<br />However, there are a few records that show they are capable of coordination.<br /><br />As the war between mankind and the God of Ruin began, a conflict broke out in the Republic of Mordana.<br />The stage of the battle was set on the Asmul Plains of Mordana, but reinforcements soon arrived from various locations of Granzelia.<br />Most notably, the Holy Kingdom of Odal and the various skyships that had sided with humanity balanced out the terrifying power. Although humanity had more technology, they were in a tight situation when the battle had started.<br /><br />This was because the commander of the ruinous army was Zouglas, one of the Four Lords. In addition to being a tactical genius, Zouglas was a one-man-army, leaving mountains of corpses. There was no stopping him and his path of destruction remained.<br /><br />While Zouglas had dominated the battle on the ground, humanity was taking over the skies. Some of the skyships had aimed their cannons at Zouglas, yet all he did was stare up and mutter.<br /><br />“So, they’ve come.”<br /><br />At first glance, anyone would’ve thought that Zouglas was talking about the skyship. Yet in that split second, the skyship was hit by multiple bolts of lightning.<br /><br />Loug Mekia had shown itself. This was one of many skyships that went up in flames that day. Far above the clouds, the Divine Beast watched as the airborne ship fell. Now that both earth and sky was dominated by the Lougsean forces, doom had been spelled out for humanity.<br />Morale for humanity plummeted and the battle turned into a one-sided massacre. The once lush green plains of Asmul turned into a scorched field, forever changing the environment to a barren wasteland. They say the land was tainted with the ruinous magic to the point that the land has never quite recovered to this day.<br /><br />The massacre at the Battle of Asmul had crushed the military power of the Republic of Mordana. Because its army was in shambles, Mordana was left as a sitting duck, an ideal target for invasion.
