	<h4>Foreign Samurai</h4>
	<strong>Unlock at Lv10</strong>
	<br /><br />
	Around the time of the Great War against the God of Ruin, a mysterious swordsman named Shin roamed Granzelia.<br />His strange clothes were out of place, and the strange 'katana' blade he loved so dearly marked him clearly as an otherworlder.<br />No one knows what his home world was really like. All that is known is that he called himself a 'samurai', which is assumed to be the general name for swordsmen there. Rumors say there is an entire village of people from his world somewhere in Mordana even today.<br />Shin himself was only interested in traveling around Granzelia to hone his skills. Whenever he heard rumors of a powerful fighter in the area he would rush to challenge them to a battle, which he usually won.<br /><br />His strength can be seen in many anecdotes, such as the following story.<br />He once faced the son of a nobleman. It was an unusual case where he'd been challenged by his opponent rather than the other way around. The nobleman's son had heard of Shin's fame and hoped to boost his own by defeating him.<br />When the time came to fight, Shin easily bested him in a clean victory. Their skills were at such different levels that it could hardly be called a true fight.<br />However, the real problem occurred that night. Shin was attacked by the man's followers, angered by his loss that afternoon. Tens of people surrounded Shin in the dead of night.<br />And yet, without showing any signs of stress, Shin managed to take them all down at lightning speed, even in the darkness. There wasn't a single injury on his body after all the fighting ended. The next day, he described the events of the night like this:<br /><br />“None of it was anything special. Surprise attacks in the dead of night, early morning assaults, it's all just a part of life.”

	Shin earned a name for himself by facing all the strongest knights in the land, but he best known for defeating the Divine Beast Radigus.<br /><br />Upon arriving in Melpolia of Aldana he saw the towns and land around them ravaged. Upon further inquiry he learned the cause of the devastation was the Divine Beast Radigus, which had rampaged through the area, wielding enormous power.<br />Aldana was under the control of the Holy Odal Empire at the time, so soldiers had only been dispatched to defend the most absolutely necessary locations. Furthermore, since the Divine Beast was a disciple of the God of Ruin, who controlled the entire world, the soldiers were prone not to do much outside of emergencies.<br />That's when Shin realized that if anyone was going to take on Radigus it would have to be him.<br /><br />People urged him not to, saying that incurring the beast's wrath would only bring further trouble, but he didn't listen. Bringing peace wasn't his only motivation — he also wanted to satisfy his desire to battle a challenging opponent.<br /><br />Finally the day came for Shin to face the Divine Beast upon its return to Melpolia. Upon its return Radigus was enraged to see that someone dared fight back, and so the powerful beast launched a devastating attack on the area.<br />Forced to defend himself, Shin appeared on the verge of failure, but in fact he was closely watching Radigus' every move. He noticed that during every attack there was a brief moment where the Divine Beast was vulnerable.<br />Then, intending to finish Shin off with one final blow, Radigus swept in with all his might, only to be met with a quick flash of steel.<br />Shin's blade had cut his foe clean in two.<br /><br />When people saw Radigus' neatly bisected body they gave Shin the title of 'God Killer' out of awe and appreciation.

	Rumors of Shin's defeat of the divine beast Radigas quickly spread throughout Granzelia, leading to a marked reduction in those who would challenge him. There were even those who shrank from fighting when Shin challenged them in battle having heard of his fierce reputation.<br />A perplexed Shin, now unable to find a strong opponent willing to engage him, resolved to retreat to the mountains for further training until the troublesome rumors blew over.<br />Just as Shin was about to begin his training, a winged figure suddenly descended from above and stood before him.<br /><br />“I have been tasked with an important mission: To test the mettle of the Otherworlder.”<br /><br />The Winged Person seemed to mutter only a few words before suddenly unleashing a fierce blow in Shin's direction. Despite being wholly unprepared for the sudden attack, Shin managed to avoid the attacker's first blow.<br />However, Shin knew in that moment that he would not be able to dodge a second or third attack nearly as effectively. With the realization that this new opponent was earnest about testing his power, Shin mounted a counterattack while continuing to evade the Winged Person's blows.<br />Though Shin's attacks were of a speed and power that would have instantly brought a typical swordsman to his knees, the Winged Person dodged them without appearing to break a sweat and Shin managed only to graze some of the latter's plumage.<br />While Shin was duly surprised at his opponent's reaction speed, the Winged Person was also caught off guard by Shin's counterattacks. The winged figure briefly revealed a startled expression before fleeing the scene.<br /><br />“What did I do to deserve being attacked like that? And who exactly was that Winged Person?”<br /><br />Though Shin's mind was full of doubt as he tried to make sense of what had just happened, such nagging uncertainty was nothing compared to the joy he now felt at finally having encountered such a willing and worthy opponent after a long, dry spell.<br />Shin, now desiring a rematch with the mysterious Winged Person, decided to set out on a journey to find him, even as he now knew he was being hunted.

	At last the battle between the God of Ruin and the humans and beasts was at hand. As battle after battle raged on, Shin never wavered in his assault on the God of Ruin's underlings and the Divine Beasts.<br />At around the same time, Shin also encountered the Winged Person who had previously challenged him in the mountains, and the two engaged in several fierce battles.<br />The battles were enough to satisfy Shin, who began to feel a kind of strange affinity for such a dedicated opponent.<br /><br />However, after several battles, the Winged Person suddenly seemed to be in great pain, and briefly became distracted. Even as he continued to bear down on Shin, their fighting style had changed completely. The Winged Person's formerly delicate and precise attacks transformed into a series of uncontrolled powerful blows unleashed with apparent abandon.<br />Shin, noticing that his opponent had lost composure, called out to the Winged Person.<br /><br />“Up to now, your attacks have been pointed and precise. Yet now I see nothing but undisciplined power and not a hint of fear, like a heavy but rusty sword with no edge. <br />I fail to see the point in continuing while you are in this state.<br />Try and get a hold of yourself!”<br /><br />He then unleashed a desperate final attack in an attempt to force his now deranged opponent into a draw.<br />Shin, now abandoning all presence of mounting a defense while concentrating all of his power into attacking, bore the full brunt of his opponent's attacks and sustained severe wounds.<br />However, Shin's attacks ultimately succeeded in breaking down the Winged Person's enraged state.<br /><br />As Shin looked on, the Winged Person gradually regained their composure. They had reverted back to their normal self. Back to normal but still flustered, the Winged Person appeared to be mulling something over.<br /><br />“Why didn't you kill me just now?” they asked Shin.<br /><br />It was a fair question from the point of view of the Winged Person, who had until now been doing everything in their power to kill Shin.<br />Shin answered without so much as a moment's hesitation.<br /><br />“I am not here to kill you. I am here for the 'contest'. It would be a shame if our contest of strength were to end in such an idiotic way.”<br /><br />Thereafter, the two fighters vanished from the battlefield without a trace, their whereabouts unknown. It is said that after Shin's wounds healed, the two met for a rematch and the intensity of the combat that followed opened a rift in space-time leading to the Otherworld, into which both were sucked. Another rumor has it that they teamed up to defeat the God of Ruin, after which they continued their duel somewhere else.<br />Though the ultimate fate of Shin and his winged antagonist remains unknown, one thing is certain:<br />A great battle of incredible ferocity unfolded between the two warriors.
