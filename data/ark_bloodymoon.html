	<h4>Night of the Blood Moon</h4>
	<strong>Unlock at Lv2</strong>
	<br /><br />
	A long time ago, the moon in the Holy Odal Kingdom would turn red during the winter under certain weather conditions. Citizens feared the red moon, refusing to go outside on nights where it sat in the sky, and instead shutting themselves up inside their homes.<br />Their reason for fearing the red moon… was a certain legend.<br />According to this legend, a night of the red moon guaranteed that someone would be murdered.<br /><br />Obviously, it was no more than an urban legend, but it did cause an actual incident. The Bloody Moon Incident occurred several years before the war against the God of Ruin.<br /><br />It was a night when the red moon was exceptionally big. A woman’s scream suddenly came from a back alley.<br />Coming from such a shady location, it wouldn’t have been out of place – perhaps a witness to two drunkards getting in a fight. However, the scream did not sound like the result of a fight.<br />It seemed different, and far more ghastly.<br />Soldiers who happened to be on patrol ran to where they heard the scream, just to be sure, but they could not find the source.<br />But the next morning, in a church near the alley, the corpse of a young woman was discovered.<br />The state of the body was… unusual, to say the least. A portion of the church’s fence had been reshaped into a makeshift cross, and the victim’s body had been attached to it. The only external wounds on the body were two holes pierced into the nape of the neck.<br />Blood had been spread across the corpse’s face like makeup.<br />Eventually, the victim was identified as a prostitute who had done business in the back alleys. While the soldiers conducing the investigation were shocked by the bizarre condition of the corpse, they determined she had been killed due to a financial dispute, and the case was closed with the culprit still at large.<br /><br />For a time, the bizarre murder was a hot topic among the citizens of Odal, though talk of it quickly fizzled out.<br />But the people would be reminded of this incident again soon enough…

	About one month after the corpse of the prostitute had been found, another night of the red moon arrived.<br />That night, no scream was heard, but the next morning, another corpse was discovered.<br />Inside a church near the exclusive residential district, a female body had been pinned to the wall in a cruciform position. Once again, the only external wounds on the body were two holes in the nape of the neck. And once more, blood decorated the corpse’s face like makeup.<br />Unlike the previous victim, however, this woman was quickly identified as belonging to a middle class family.<br />The emergence of a second victim of the same bizarre murder method shook the citizens of Odal, and rumors began to spread.<br /><br />“The red moon is a sign that the Soul Reaper is seeking the offering of a human soul.”<br />“A human with Beast blood has snuck into the city, and on the night of the red moon, his powers awaken and he kills someone.”<br /><br />…An infinite number of stories spread, their only commonality being the keywords “red moon”. Eventually, many came to say, “The moon turns red because of the curse of an ancient family wiped out by the King of Odal”.<br /><br />The kingdom could not allow such a rumor, however, and so sent a knight named Orto to investigate.<br />Orto lacked actual combat experience against Beasts and was not very skilled with the sword, but he had gained many achievements in criminal investigations and cracking down on the black market, which made him the most suitable man for the job.<br /><br />Orto’s subordinates, the city guard, learned from their investigation that the city was in a state of unrest due to all of the rumors flying about.<br />The soldiers reassured the people that there were no Beasts or curses involved in the recent murders, and reiterated that only the truth should be reported.<br />Meanwhile, Orto consulted one of his friends – a magic scholar – about the string of incidents.

	<h4>The Investigation Hits a Snag</h4>

	<br /><br />
	Orto’s magic scholar friend had this to say about the incidents:<br /><br />“I don’t know the connection between the murders and the red moon.<br />But judging by the unique wounds of the victims, the culprit – be they human or Beast – must have some sort of magic power.<br />The matter of victims being crucified in churches and their faces made up in blood probably have no particular relevance to magic.<br />I believe this is simply the murderer’s aesthetic.”<br /><br />Orto agreed with his friend’s observations and narrowed the investigation to those who were proficient in magic, predisposed to magic, or who possessed magic artifacts. He then tried searching among that list of people for anyone with a particularly unusual aesthetic, but nobody seemed to fit the bill, making for a challenging investigation.<br />As Orto mulled over the clues, a third murder occurred.<br />On the roof of an ancient, traditional church, one attended even by royalty, another similarly crucified female body was found.<br />As with the previous incidents, there were only two wounds on the nape of the neck, and the face was made up in blood.<br />The victim was the daughter of a certain noble family, and sure enough, the night before her body was discovered, there had been a red moon.<br /><br />Orto saw a pattern in that the victims’ social class was gradually rising, and concluded that the culprit was targeting women of higher and higher status to use as his “canvases”.<br />And since this newest victim was a member of a noble family, he reasoned that the culprit could only be someone who was allowed near such nobility.<br />Through careful investigation of the area around the crime scene, Orto gained intel that a certain noble had been frequently visiting the church as of late.<br />That noble’s name was Muteus.<br />He was the eldest son of a high-ranking noble family in the Holy Odal Kingdom, but his parents had recently died of a mysterious illness, and thus the young Muteus had become the head of the family. He was accomplished in both the literary and military arts, earning him a solid reputation.<br />His outstanding looks and mild, sociable demeanor meant he was considered suitable as a next generation noble.<br /><br />Orto visited Muteus at his home for questioning.<br />The home seemed to reflect its owner, as it was furnished with high-quality decorations and had a garden full of beautiful roses in every color.<br />Muteus welcomed Orto and said he would gladly cooperate with the investigation. He amicably answered every one of the knight’s questions. Nothing seemed unnatural about his words, so Orto’s suspicions faded.<br />However, when he thanked the host for his time and was walked out to the entrance, Orto noticed something peculiar about Muteus’ behavior.

	<br /><br />
	What was it about Muteus’ behavior that set Orto off?<br />Whenever Muteus spotted anything in or around the house that was even a little off-center or out of place, he would almost compulsively fix it.<br />After his long history of criminal investigations, Orto knew that people with eccentric aesthetics and obsessions would often have an oddly neurotic side to them. Casting a suspicious glance at Muteus, Orto began to inquire about his parents, the ones who had died of a mysterious illness. It had been years since Muteus’ parents had passed, but as they were high-ranking nobles, the circumstances of their deaths had been recorded in great detail.<br />According to the record, his parents died on the night of a red moon.<br />And while the cause of death was unclear, there were mysterious wounds on their necks that looked much like drilled-out holes.<br /><br />Convinced that Muteus was the culprit, Orto rushed into his house with a subordinate to arrest him. When Orto pointed out that he had investigated his parents’ deaths and noted the commonality between their bodies and the corpses in the recent string of incidents, Muteus easily confessed to the crimes.<br />He calmly testified:<br /><br />“Those incidents were indeed my doing. What did you think of them? Beautiful, weren’t they…?<br />But perhaps it was a mistake for me to go after my own parents.<br />I thought it would be beautiful, poetic even, to use the blood of my blood… but it seems it was an error on my part.”<br /><br />When Orto did not react, and simply approached him to arrest him, Muteus sighed and said, “I guess you don’t understand…”<br />He waved his cloak, and a gust of wind suddenly spiraled out from it, knocking back Orto and his subordinate.<br />When he stood back up and looked toward Muteus, Orto could not believe his eyes.<br />Despite it being daylight just a moment ago, the whole area was engulfed in the dark of night, and the red moon shone through the open window.<br /><br />But the vision immediately disappeared.<br />By the time Orto snapped back to his senses, Muteus had disappeared.<br />Orto stayed his confused heart and ordered his subordinate to search the residence. <br />As he expected, however, Muteus was nowhere to be found.<br />Afterward, Muteus became a wanted man throughout all of Odal, but there was no further information about him, and he could not be arrested.<br /><br />On subsequent nights of the red moon, no more women died of strange circumstances, thus ending the Bloody Moon Incident.<br />Peace eventually returned to Odal’s castle town, but the seeds of fear had been sown deep within the people, and the red moon became known as the “Bloody Moon”, a detested omen of misfortune.<br />The missing Muteus was christened the “Blood Rose” after the flowers he had been growing in his garden, and he was feared as a mysterious malefactor for years to come.
