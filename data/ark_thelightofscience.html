	<br /><br />
	In a small rural village in a world different from Granzelia, a “miracle” was recreated by science.<br /><br />Hunt, gather food, and survive. Such was the primitive life in the village before a young genius scientist came about, making various things the villagers had never seen before. They were wary at first, calling his science “sorcery”.<br /><br />Despite that, some of the villagers helped the scientist by gathering materials such as iron, copper, phosphorus, and eventually helping to make magnets. He claimed that there was no darkness in his age. That with science, humanity defeated the night and conquered all 24 hours of the day. Using the materials everyone had worked to gather, he lit the darkness of the night for the first time in 3700 years.<br /><br />The light of science.
