	<h4>Raging Beast</h4>
	<strong>Unlock at Lv10</strong>
	<br /><br />
	The Gaoul are a race of beasts made in the likeness of a dog or wolf, though they are significantly larger and bear fangs and claws of impressive lethality.<br /><br />They are ferocious in character, and tend to attack other lifeforms indiscriminately regardless of whether or not they are actually hungry.<br />For this reason, they will often get into foolish scuffles with opponents stronger than themselves wherein the tables are often turned on them. However, they will not indiscriminately attack those of the same race, and will sometimes, though very rarely, team up with other Gaoul.<br /><br />They also breed prodigiously and can be found in virtually every corner of the globe. For this reason, villages in remote areas are sometimes forced to invite knights and adventurers from the city to remove Gaoul invaders.

	<h4>History of Repelling</h4>
	<strong>Unlock at Lv30</strong>
	<br /><br />
	The Gaoul are famous for their frequent incursions into human territory, where they are usually responsible for all kinds of mischief.<br />They are known to be fond of raiding farms, and even occasionally kidnapping human children, and are thus regarded as a serious threat by those living in villages close to Gaoul habitats.<br /><br />For peaceful townsfolk, the sheer strength of these Gaoul make them difficult to deal with. And when warriors cannot be deployed from the city, humans on the frontier have little ability to resist the tyranny of these beasts.<br /><br />It was under such circumstances that a young man came forward to rid his town of the Gaoul destroying his village. He attempted to stand up to the Gaoul alone in a forest on the outskirts of the village, so as to not put his fellow villagers in danger, but he was unfortunately defeated.<br />Having sustained serious injuries, the young man had no choice but to flee back to his home in the village.<br /><br />Shortly afterward, he used the experience of his defeat to harden his skills and resolve, and recruited several friends to help him confront the Gaoul again. Once again, the young man fought the Gaoul, but this time he succeeded in driving them from the area surrounding the village.<br /><br />His deed served as a ray of hope in dark times when villagers were largely at the mercy of the Gaoul.<br />Since then, the courage and strength that the youths showed in battle has served as an example for subsequent villager-led defensive operations.

	<h4>Wild Intelligence</h4>
	<strong>Unlock at Lv50</strong>
	<br /><br />
	Various theories have been put forward to explain why the Gaoul generally do not form packs.<br />Some say that they are too lazy to form groups while others say they do not possess the intelligence to maintain group cohesion, but the exact reason continues to elude scholars.<br /><br />However, when they do act in a coordinated fashion, their ferocity and savagery far eclipses what they are capable of when committing evil deeds by themselves.<br />It came to pass one day that a group of villagers living close to a Gaoul habitat attempted a first strike attack in an attempt to eliminate the threat posed by the beasts.<br /><br />However, the Gaoul, sensing that they were in danger, let forth a powerful howl as a cry for help, and in no time at all, a horde of Gaoul had formed. They reportedly invaded the human village before a first strike could be mounted, driving out the villagers who lived there.<br /><br />Gaoul occupation of the town continued for several months before a company of knights from the city succeeded in recapturing the village.

	<h4>Sounding Howl</h4>
	<strong>Unlock at Lv80</strong>
	<br /><br />
	Though Gaoul do not generally form packs, they are known to hold regular gatherings that function somewhat like a meeting.<br /><br />Though it is not clear exactly with what frequency these “meetings” are held, they typically start after dark, with multiple individual Gaoul letting loose powerful howls near sundown as a sign that the gathering is about to commence.<br /><br />Additional research into these gatherings have the potential to bear fruit in terms of understanding how these beasts communicate, but as of now the answer to the above question remains beyond the reach of  humanity.<br /><br />During the gatherings, the Gaoul maintain a state of high alertness and will immediately use their fangs to take care of any interlopers crashing the gathering, so if you happen to come upon one, you would be well advised to avoid startling the participants.
