	<h4>A Foreign Country</h4>
	<strong>Unlock at Lv2</strong>
	<br /><br />
	Many beings hailing from different worlds are known to dwell within Granzelia. Perhaps one of the most well-known of these are the otherworlders hailing from “Megrona”, including the swordsman Shin.<br />Exchanges between the humans of Granzelia and the Megronians can be traced back quite far in the historical record, and some say that it was the Megronians who were responsible for bringing a culture of eating raw fish to Granzelia. On the other hand, research into the otherworld Megrona continues apace in Granzelia, with a large body of scholarly literature already established.<br /><br />We of Granzelia call the homeworld of the swordsman Shin “Megrona” but that is not its original name. The people of Megrona are generally not aware of the existence of other worlds, so they have given no special name to their own world.<br />So, where does the name “Megrona” come from?<br />It is derived from the name of the “nation” where Shin and his contemporaries grew up. Oddly enough, all Megronians who have made their way into Granzelia thus far all hail from Shin’s home nation of Megrona, so in our world, their entire homeworld has naturally come to be referred to simply as “Megrona”.<br /><br />The country of Megrona is politically organized in a manner similar to the monarchies of our world, and is ruled by a king who is given the title of General. Although there are many individuals living within Granzelia who are referred to by the title of General, in the world of Megrona, “General” has a peculiar meaning. The title of General is generally hereditary in nature and passed down from parent to child, but this is not always the case and, in some cases, a General may be replaced during a rebellion or political coup.<br />Historical records speak of rare but not entirely infrequent cases in which, for example, a young man born into a family of farmers rises through the ranks during wartime, eventually reaching the top of the hierarchy to the status of General.

	<h4>Samurai</h4>
	<strong>Unlock at Lv4</strong>
	<br /><br />
	In Megrona, warriors and swordsmen are generally referred to as samurai. Samurai who serve a General may become deeply involved in the administrative affairs of government as well as military endeavors. Even more interestingly, the government of the nation of Megrona is administered not by professional politicians or bureaucrats but rather these samurai. Naturally, the samurai which serve the nation’s generals are granted a higher status and authority than those belonging to the other professions, and are even given the right to kill anyone who fails to show them the proper level of respect.<br /><br />These samurai sometimes take actions that would be unthinkable from the standpoint of our world. One example is the ritual of “self-disembowelment” which may be performed by a samurai who has committed a grave mistake or failure. “Self-disembowelment” is a process whereby a samurai uses a blade to cut open his own stomach – that is, it is a form of ritual suicide. It is said that this act is performed most often among samurai with higher levels of authority and status.<br />Shin, who once made a name for himself in Granzelia, spoke about the practice thus.<br />“I have never been involved with the practice of self-disembowelment myself, but I know of some who have attempted it. I have even heard of some who have performed the act as a way of taking the blame for their superiors’ mistakes. For some samurai, it is an act that confers great honor.”<br /><br />The famous Megrona researcher Rogner explains this strange behavior as follows:<br />“The denizens of Megrona… particularly the samurai, place a great emphasis on respect and decorum. Thus, when they fail or commit a shameful act, they are reported to experience a greater degree of mental anguish or stress than we can possibly imagine. My guess is that ‘self-disembowelment’ first developed as a means of escaping from this pressure before it became formalized and ritualized, eventually becoming an integral part of Megrona’s cultural aesthetic.”

	<h4>Food Culture</h4>
	<strong>Unlock at Lv7</strong>
	<br /><br />
	We noted previously that travelers from Megrona are famous for having brought over their culture of eating raw fish, but they are also known for having brought over several other interesting culinary traditions.<br /><br />Records speak of something called a “Dancing Dinner” in which smaller fish and other seafood are consumed while still alive. However, the act of putting something alive and wriggling into one’s mouth is a bit difficult to swallow even for the famously adventurous people of Granzelia, and the practice currently remains limited to a small group of aficionados.<br /><br />Additionally, though the majority of egg dishes belonging to the Granzelia tradition are mostly cooked, the people of Megrona have been reported to eat them raw, topped with their own distinctive sauce. However, natives of Granzelia who have tried the above cuisine almost always inevitably develop indigestion and even some Megronians have been reported to vomit when indulging said dish. It turns out that all eggs used in this special cuisine must be extremely fresh and clean. Only a few areas in Granzelia are capable of supplying such eggs and the consumption of raw eggs is regarded among the upper classes as one of the most decadent ways of eating them.<br /><br />Megronians also have a unique culinary tradition whereby various ingredients are boiled in a single pot, which is then placed on a table for everyone to share together. Although such a “hotpot” approach to cuisine has been used in Granzelia as a means of cooking in the wilderness, the inhabitants of our world are generally not known to eat together out of the same pot at a formal dinner table.<br />According to the Megronians, eating from one pot together is supposed to strengthen the bonds of friendship and family, promoting unity and harmony.

	<h4>Spirit of Megrona</h4>
	<strong>Unlock at Lv10</strong>
	<br /><br />
	Although difficult to imagine among the inhabitants of Granzelia, the Megronians do not believe that any singular god of overwhelming power exists in their world. They instead believe that spirits dwell within everything, both living and non-living, that exists in the world, to which they offer their deepest gratitude and devotion.<br />For example, before a meal, they will speak the phrase “Thank you for what we are about to receive”. This is an expression of thanks directed towards the Spirits which inhabit the food to be eaten.<br />Additionally, in their world, minor shrines dedicated to these spirits can be found almost everywhere, and the people of Megrona often make pilgrimages to these shrines to obtain the spirits’ blessing.<br /><br />As mentioned above, in Megrona, there are no gods of overwhelming power like in Granzelia; it is further claimed by Megronians that none of their gods were in fact born as such. Though it may seem unbelievable, the Megronians claim that in their world, it is possible for a human to become a god. Of course, it goes without saying that the procedure involved is not at all easy.<br />One must first separate oneself from all the temptations and desires of the human world, live a rigorous acetic lifestyle and train oneself to a point where the heart and mind become completely different from that of a normal human. Although many in Megrona engage in intense self-cultivation with the goal of becoming a god, the majority lose their lives to the intense acetic lifestyle demanded of them.<br /><br />The few who succeed in powering through such harsh cultivation practices awaken to a higher level of enlightened consciousness incomprehensible to the average person. It is precisely this state of enlightenment that corresponds to the first step on the path to godhood.<br />Those who awaken to enlightenment gradually lose their sense of separation with the larger universe, eventually losing their corporeal form entirely. Once such a state has been reached, the practitioner will lose his connection to the mortal world entirely and a path toward the Realm of the Gods is said to thus open up.
