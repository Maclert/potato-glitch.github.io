	<strong>Unlock at Lv10</strong>
	<br /><br />
	A sorcerer who served as the confidante to Roland, the Prince of Aldana Empire.<br />Eliza has many titles, being the director of Aldana Empire's Department of Information and a member of the Council of Ten. It is said that she oversees every piece of intel within the Empire.<br />She is a powerful sorcerer, one whose aggressive personality strikes fear into her subordinates and many others. Eliza is also known for her deep loyalty to Prince Roland, often acting as one of his trusted right-hand aides.<br />There's a story that perfectly depicts her capability in obtaining and handling intel.<br /><br />One day, a certain Knight was suddenly arrested by the Department of Information on charges of treason. Since he seemed so blameless, some suspected that the arrest was actually retaliation for when the Knight drunkenly slandered the prince.<br />Many were terrified by the prospect that Eliza would so eagerly frame someone for the prince's sake. However, as time went by, it became clear that the knight had indeed given intelligence on the empire to the Blaze.<br />Though people changed their tune and praised Eliza, she simply calmly reiterated that the Knight had been a traitor all along. But when she was later praised in passing by the prince, her eyes burned with passion.<br /><br />Though Eliza is known for her shrewdness and feared by many, one episode shows another side of her:<br /><br />One day, Eliza called a female agent into her office. Having barely ever spoken to Eliza, the agent trembled in fear of what was to come, but — surprisingly enough — Eliza just wanted ask how to raise a cat.<br />The female agent later gave a description of her experience.<br /><br />"To be honest, I was scared to death before I entered that room.<br />I mean, it was a meeting with the director. When she started asking me questions about raising cats, I was shocked — I mean, well, it was like, um, like seeing a side of Eliza that most people don't know.<br />She was hiding a little scratch on her hand, so I guess she's got her hands full with a little furball."

	<br /><br />
	Despite her glorious titles as a member of the Council of Ten and director of the Department of Information, Eliza was born into a family of impoverished nobles.<br />She showed great talents in magic early on, but her family's financial straits meant she couldn't afford tuition at any magic institutes.<br />Eliza might have given up on becoming a sorcerer if it wasn't for the help of her neighbor, a young lady said to be an unparalleled genius in swordsmanship. In the end, the neighbor's recommendation won Eliza a place in a magic institute.<br /><br />In exchange for her help, the young lady — who went on to become the prince's sword instructor — asked Eliza to bring lunch for her brother, the prince, and herself during the days of practice.<br />That's when Eliza first met Roland. It is said that Eliza was instantly captivated by Roland's noble elegance and dignified behavior. At first, Eliza was so nervous that she would freeze every time Roland spoke to her. But in time, she became close to Roland and Lanceveil.<br /><br />After Eliza entered the magic institute, her talent in sorcery finally flowered. Within three months, she had already published a method to create a wand with abilities to boost magic power beyond traditional measures.<br />The professors were astonished by her achievements, saying that she was the greatest genius since the institute was founded. They named the wand after Eliza and have kept it in the institute to this day. It became a tradition to award the top sorcerer of the year with a replica of the Eliza wand.<br /><br />With her excellent grades, Eliza was close to graduation when she was suddenly visited by the young lady that recommended her to the institute:<br />"Eli, you often get so focused on a certain thing that you fail to see your surroundings clearly. Sometimes, it's just as important to take a step back and look around you."<br /><br />This was the advice the young lady gave to Eliza. Knowing her since childhood, Eliza could tell that she was not her usual self — that something was off.<br />Although Eliza wanted to ask more questions, she felt this meeting meant something special, so she nodded in silence. The next day, Eliza learned of the news that the young lady had left the empire.

	After graduating from the magical institute, Eliza was employed by the Ministry of Magic, which researches ruins and magic.<br />This was a common destination for the best graduates of the institute, and seeing how Eliza had no other goals, it was a fitting one. While there, she showed her abilities to the fullest, producing many outstanding results in her research field.<br /><br />On one occasion, Prince Roland was to inspect ancient ruins with his personal knight, escorted by the Ministry of Magic. Since Eliza hadn't met Roland since their childhood practice, she volunteered to take part in hopes of meeting him again.<br />When she met Roland at the ruins, however, Eliza was crestfallen to learn that Roland already forgotten those childhood memories — but just then, an incident happened to occur.<br /><br />During the inspection of the ruins, an ancient weapon was activated. Normally a master sorcerer like Eliza could have defended herself from it; however, trapped in the depths of her sadness, she was unable to.<br />But to her surprise, Prince Roland himself shielded Eliza from the attack. The astonished Eliza was dumbstruck as the prince's guardian knight quickly destroyed the weapon.<br /><br />After the battle ended, Eliza felt the urge to ask Prince Roland why he would protect someone he'd forgotten. To this Roland replied:<br />"It is my duty as the Prince of Aldana Empire to defend my citizens. I would have done the same for any of them, whether they're an acquaintance or not."<br /><br />The inspection ended without further incident. Roland didn't say a word to Eliza before leaving the ancient ruins, but his words and actions were already enough for Eliza.<br />After returning to the Imperial Capital, she soon resigned from the Ministry of Magic and applied for a position at the Department of Information. Eliza at last had a goal: to develop her own abilities to become an aide to the prince.

	The Department of Information, which handles all intel obtained by the empire, was charged with the power to arrest rebels and Blaze spies. In the department, magical ability was not valued so much as the ability to distinguish truth from lies, but Eliza was gifted in both respects. Not long after entering, she rounded up a great number of rebels and Blaze supporters.<br /><br />However, none of her achievements were properly acknowledged. Department Director Richter was a devoted follower of the emperor – and since the emperor often clashed with the prince, Richter often looked askew at the prince's supporters.<br />All of Eliza's achievements were attributed to others or ignored, making it difficult for her to advance in the organization. She was constantly complaining to her childhood friends out of frustration.<br /><br />Everything changed when Eliza was one day reviewing the Department of Information's managerial records. A tip-off from an informant suggested that a second account book had been skillfully concealed; and though Eliza had her doubts, she successfully located not only the account book, but also evidence that Richter had abused his power to line his pockets.<br />Eliza could easily blow the whistle on Richter and remove him from his position. For a moment she was about to present the evidence to the Chiefs of Staff but stopped, realizing that this could intensify the conflict between partisans of the emperor and the prince.<br /><br />Aided by a Knight-cum-childhood friend, Eliza was able to consult with Roland on what to do. He replied, "Don't concern yourself with me. You should act as you wish."<br /><br />With Roland's approval, Eliza quickly brought the evidence of Richter's corruption to the upper echelons and led the military police to arrest Richter. Now in complete control of the Department of Information, she ordered the confiscation of Richter's ill-gotten riches – not least of which was Richter's regal mansion. Understanding the circumstances, Richter's family members relocated without resistance, but his young daughter approached Eliza to ask for a favor.<br /><br />"Mommy said we have to leave the house, so I can't take Luche with me. Can you take care of Luche for me? Please?"<br />Saying this, the girl handed over the cat – Luche – to Eliza. Little did the girl know that Eliza was the person who imprisoned her father. But not even Eliza could decline the request of a child in tears.<br /><br />After Eliza was officially inaugurated as the director of the Department of Information, Roland appointed her to be a member of the Imperial Council, otherwise known as the Council of Ten. Eliza now acts as Roland's eyes and ears, gathering a wealth of intelligence throughout Granzelia, hoping to someday fulfil the prince's hopes for her.
