	<h4>Underwater Warrior</h4>
	<strong>Unlock at Lv10</strong>
	<br /><br />
	The Sahagin are a race of half-man, half-fish beasts.<br />Though they are regarded as having the ability to understand human speech, they can produce little themselves and at most speak only in fragments.<br />Therefore, they are often regarded as a race of low intelligence. However, their brains are not altogether inferior to humans, and the Sahagin's inability to speak in nothing longer than fragments has more to do with the structure of their mouths, which are poorly adapted to producing human speech.<br /><br />Although as half-man, half-fish beasts, the Sahagin's range is primarily restricted to the seas and rivers. They are seldom found on land, though they have been known to occasionally appear on land for short periods of time.<br /><br />Though the Sahagin are partial to the use of tridents as weapons, they are also known to make use of other armaments. On the other hand, they do not appear to be fond of using armor, and there have been no reported sightings of Sahagin individuals wearing it.<br />It is presumed that their aversion to armor is related to the fact that wearing it would hinder their ability to move quickly through the water.

	<h4>Absolute Discipline</h4>
	<strong>Unlock at Lv30</strong>
	<br /><br />
	Since the Sahagin's range is primarily underwater, research into their nature has progressed slowly, despite their being relatively well known among laypeople.<br /><br />There are many mysteries about these unique beasts that have yet to be uncovered. What little that is known about them includes the fact that they tend to act in groups, wherein a very strict level of discipline is maintained.<br />Although the rules used to maintain said discipline are determined by the leader of each group, there may be instances in which even a leader is restricted by the group's strict rules.<br /><br />The Sahagin generally do not leave their own territory and they seldom incur upon human habitats without good reason. However, they will reportedly fearlessly confront those who dare encroach on their territory.

	<h4>Giving Back</h4>
	<strong>Unlock at Lv50</strong>
	<br /><br />
	Although the Sahagin are a particularly mysterious race of beasts, they are often encountered by those who make their living on or by the sea, many of whom will share personal anecdotes about them when asked.<br /><br />One such fisherman discovered an injured Sahagin while trawling for fish. Despite his fear, the fisherman tended to the Sahagin’s wounds, after which the creature thanked him in halting speech before disappearing back into the ocean.<br />Later, when the fisherman once again set out to trawl his patch of ocean, his boat was suddenly surrounded by a large host of Sahagin. The fisherman looked on in amazement as the large group of Sahagin offered him a massive catch of fish.<br />Scanning the creatures before him, the fisherman saw the Sahagin who he had tended to on that fateful day.<br /><br /><br />The fisherman’s story quickly circulated amongst other fishermen far and wide. Even today, many who make their living at sea believe that a Sahagin will always repay a kindness done to them.

	<h4>Unforgettable Revenge</h4>
	<strong>Unlock at Lv80</strong>
	<br /><br />
	While several tales tell of how the Sahagin repay kindness, there are also stories that speak of the race’s darker side.<br /><br />In a remote port town, there once lived a boy who by some turn of events learned that a group of Sahagin who lived in nearby waters secretly possessed a great treasure.<br />Using a map which showed the treasure’s location, he was able to locate the treasure and steal it. The enterprising young man leveraged his discovery to successfully build a commercial empire spanning the entire world.<br />However, a few years later, one of the boy’s ships which was loaded with goods for trade, was sunk after being attacked by a group of Sahagin.<br />The boy, convinced that the Sahagin had exacted their revenge on him for stealing their treasure, assembled a contingent of warships and soldiers and set out to subjugate the Sahagin.<br />However, the warships never returned, and when they were finally discovered by a search team, they were completely empty.<br /><br />Those who heard the boy’s tale presumed that the Sahagin has simply taken their revenge on the boy. From that day on, the fearsome tenacity of the Sahagin, who were willing to spend years seeking out the person who had wronged them, before exacting their revenge, became part of the popular consciousness.
