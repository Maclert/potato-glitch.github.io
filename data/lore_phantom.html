	<h4>Leaving a Memory</h4>
	<strong>Unlock at Lv10</strong>
	<br /><br />
	It is said that when a person who was strong of will, or strong in magic, departs this world with unresolved longing or hate, they may reappear in the form of a monstrosity.<br />Entities manifested from a soul that has remained after death, include those traditionally known as Skeletons, as well as other varieties which share some common traits.<br /><br />Unlike skeletons, phantoms are known to retain the thoughts and feelings they had while still alive. But in general, their disposition is dominated by longing or hate which they felt at the time of death, and tends to deviate far outside the range of what most would consider normal.<br />Though some individual specimens will attack anyone they encounter indiscriminately, others will go after a specific individual and completely ignore anyone and anything else.<br /><br />These differences are said to spring from the type of hate or longing felt by the soul the moment it was transmuted into a phantom. Especially powerful specimens are reported to also have the ability to absorb the life energy of living people.<br />Anyone unfortunate enough to have their life essence absorbed in such a way will not only become incredibly weak, both mentally and physically, but may even lose many years' worth of memories.<br />Though physical attacks can be used to keep them at bay, a weapon imbued with special magic is required to completely eradicate and purify them.<br /><br />It is of course, also possible to grant the tormented soul the release it craves by resolving the hate or longing which it holds onto.<br />In the following section, we will look at several stories of those who encountered phantoms, as well as other phantom-related rumors which have been passed down through the ages till today.

	<h4>Robbed Soul</h4>
	<strong>Unlock at Lv30</strong>
	<br /><br />
	It is said that one's soul will be sucked out without warning when one is unlucky enough to encounter a phantom holding onto a particularly deep hatred or longing.<br /><br />One tale tells of an adventurer who, while sleeping outside in the wilderness, suddenly woke up to hear what sounded like a human voice emanating from the distance.<br />The adventurer thought it strange to hear such a voice since he had already checked to make sure there were no other humans in the area before going to sleep. He began to search the surrounding area.<br />As the story goes, the adventurer eventually came upon a hooded human-like figure standing before him in the darkness. The strange voice appeared to belong to the figure.<br />As he strained to listen, the adventurer could hear what sounded like sobbing.<br /><br />Though the adventurer found the whole spectacle unnerving, he was in no condition to abandon the apparition and go back to bed, and so he got closer to the source of the voice. He could hear the voice mumbling something indistinct which sounded similar to, “I... it…"<br />Though suitably frightened, the adventurer steeled his nerves as he asked the voice what was wrong.<br /><br />“Yooooou were... the one who did... it, aren't you?!”<br /><br />The apparent owner of the voice screamed suddenly as it drifted toward the adventurer and attacked. The terrified adventurer fled down the mountain where he had made camp to a nearby village, but after only one day, his body is reported to have become completely dried out as though all the moisture had been sucked out from it.<br /><br />Many speculated as to the identity of the person to whom the voice belonged, with some saying that it was a girl who lost her life on the mountain. Others said that it was a male climber unable to return home due to an unforeseen accident.<br />However, all who learned of the incident agreed that what the adventurer had encountered was a phantom which had become feral due to a strong, unresolved sense of longing.

	<h4>Battle Scars</h4>
	<strong>Unlock at Lv50</strong>
	<br /><br />
	The literature alludes to another previous case study in which a large number of souls belonging to warriors, who had died in the throes of regret on a certain battlefield, had transmuted into phantoms.<br /><br />It was said that these lost souls could no longer be placated by peaceful means, due to their longing over a battle long since ended, and could only be extinguished by armed subjugation.<br /><br />The king who held dominion over the land where the old battlefield lay, initially put up a reward for the subjugation of the phantoms. The amount was enough to enlist the aid of many an enterprising mercenary, but those who sought the reward had their souls taken from them one after another.<br /><br />It was then that the king changed his strategy. Though the expense was much greater than the king's previous solution, he directly enlisted the services of several mages and warriors to form an army tasked with the subjugation of the phantoms. The provisional army was ultimately successful in eradicating the phantoms.<br />Thereafter, a memorial tower was built on the battlefield to enshrine the souls of the heroes who had fought for their country.

	<h4>The Curse of Living</h4>
	<strong>Unlock at Lv80</strong>
	<br /><br />
	There have also been reports of phantoms which retained their prior memories for reasons unrelated to war.<br /><br />There is one story in particular which originates from a small farming village. Local history speaks of a rich man who had monopolized the interests of the town for a long time. The rich man thought of almost nothing except his own enrichment and was regarded as a person of little virtue.<br /><br />One night, as the wealthy miser was tabulating his daily profits in his mansion, he sensed a cold chill seemingly out of nowhere. As the startled man looked around he spied a creature floating beside him, covered entirely from the head down.<br /><br />The creature is reported to have bellowed, “I will finally have justice for your exploitation of me when I was alive,” before absorbing the man’s energy and memories.<br />After regaining consciousness, the man had forgotten entirely who he was, and he and his house fell into ruin shortly thereafter, never having recorded his memories.<br /><br />The above story is based on the testimony of one of the rich man’s servants who were present in the mansion at the time of the incident. The same servant later became increasingly weak in spirit and gradually seemed to lose his will to live before disappearing entirely.
