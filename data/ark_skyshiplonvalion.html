	<h4>The Name of the Vessel</h4>

	How many lives have I seen cut tragically short? And how many more will I see before I share their fate?<br />One by one, my friends have boarded skyships and gone to battle with their hopes and dreams in tow, never to be seen again.<br />They all fought for freedom.<br />Freedom from the most tyrannical despots mankind has ever known.<br /><br />Except for one... the one who died for my sake.<br />The one who would've been spared if I'd been left to reap what I sowed. That day, I fought against the despots. I was confident in my piloting skills, cocksure that nobody on either side could best me.<br />Oh, how conceited I was in those days...<br /><br />A storm blew at that very moment, its gusts blowing the rudder wildly astray.<br />But I put more confidence in my skills than they deserved and pressed on. It'd be nice to say I was driven to avenge my fallen friends, but I couldn't deny that I was more driven to prove my ability. And because of that, I let the enemy corner me from upwind.<br /><br />It was all over for me. I was saying my prayers... and then it happened.<br />That person, my comrade who'd been flying by my side this whole time, shot forward and rammed right into the enemy's flank.<br />I wiped out the enemies in their confusion and tried to find my friend in the wreckage of the rammed ship, but it was too late. My friend died because of my own foolish pride.<br />At least the despot went down too.<br /><br />I'll keep fighting with your memory on my shoulders.<br />I'll never forget our promise. My spirit will be always be with the skyship that shares your name... Lonvalion.

	Yesterday at dawn, a large ship appeared in the sky.<br />We don't mean to say it flew from somewhere. It literally appeared out of thin air. We've obtained eyewitness testimony from a farmer, which goes as follows:<br /><br />“I just went outside to check on my crops. Then I looked up and somethin' wasn't lookin' right, like the sky was all... puckered up?<br />Thought it was mighty strange 'til a ship popped up outta nowhere!”<br /><br />Shortly afterward, the ship darted away at high speed. We've asked an expert skyship engineer for his analysis:<br /><br />“After hearing his story, I asked the witness to draw a sketch of what he saw. And I'm afraid I've never seen anything like it.<br />A ship that big traveling so quickly? I know I'm no top-class engineer, but that's way beyond what I'm capable of creating. Heck, I bet you could ask any engineer in the world and they'd tell you the same thing.<br />If someone out there could, they'd change the world overnight. Maybe he was just seeing things?”<br /><br />This engineer was a leader in his field, so many people initially agreed that there must have been some mistake. However, more and more sightings of this ship came in, including one with my very own eyes.<br />The existence of this skyship soon became public knowledge, but we had no clues as to who made it, or where they were from. It's worrying to have no idea why it shows up, but just the other day, it was seen doing battle with the God of Ruin's followers.<br />When touring the town for citizens' opinions of the ship, many people gave mixed responses out of fear of the God of Ruin's wrath. To many, attitudes toward this skyship are tantamount to attitudes toward the God of Ruin.<br /><br />— Excerpt from “Chasing the Giant Ship Magazine”

	As mentioned previously, the giant ship that appears in the sky continues to head off the God of Ruin's followers.<br />We can't promise to have captured all of its deeds due to its high speed, but based on eyewitness testimonies, we've summarized a few below:<br /><br />First, there was the battle by the northern mountains. The mountain ranges have long been considered the god's domain. People still lived there, of course, but enduring the inhumane torment from self-proclaimed oracles was a fact of life.<br />It was here that the skyship suddenly materialized, wiping out the cruel oracles at once. You could say it saved those people from suffering.<br />The mountain-dwellers cheered for the ship and tried to thank its pilot, but it left as quickly as it had come.<br /><br />Our next story comes from a battle above a plain. Like the northern mountains, the people living in these plains were terrorized constantly by the God of Ruin's followers.<br />Until the giant ship appeared.<br />While the ship mostly repeated what it had done in the mountains, one testimonial made this battle stand out. Apparently, the giant ship provided cover for the townspeople.<br /><br />According to our source, people feared they'd be caught int he crossfire when the battle began, and immediately sought refuge.<br />But not everyone could escape in time. Just as the God of Ruin's followers' magic fell upon them... nothing happened. The villagers looked up to find that the giant ship had shielded the stragglers and absorbed the blow itself.<br />Once everyone made it to safety, the giant ship wiped out the God of Ruin's followers.<br /><br />Who could the pilot of this ship be?<br />In fact, does the ship even have a pilot?<br />Leaving more questions than answers, the giant ship once again disappeared into the clouds.<br /><br />— Excerpt from “Chasing the Giant Ship Magazine”

	<h4>Examining the Giant Ship</h4>

	<br /><br />
	These were but a few of these articles printed at the time this ship appeared. The ship wasn't just the subject of magazines: there were multitudes of scholarly papers discussing it as well. One such paper theorized that the giant ship was built somewhere other than Granzelia.<br />Later Granzelia ships, such as the Durandal, were able to mimic the giant mystery ship's engineering, but many scholars strongly believe that its construction would have been impossible with our level of technology at the time.<br /><br />So where was the giant ship built?<br />Some scholars suggest that it proves the existence of other worlds. Perhaps the ship drifted here from a different world?<br />But that doesn't explain the ship's obvious targeting of the God of Ruin's followers. It clearly had a very deep grudge against the God of Ruin. It's therefore safe to assume that the ship had some reason for its appearances, but given how scarce skyship access was in those days, there's no evidence to support this.<br /><br />Rumor has it that there was a human and a monster who tirelessly tracked this lightning-fast ship. They were allies of the ship and assisted it in battle, but their very existence is treated as a myth, as records of them lack credibility.<br />Should we trust those documents, then according to that pair, the giant ship was supposedly piloted by a lone hero who made it their mission to take on the God of Ruin.<br />However, that's merely hearsay, and since it's unknown as to whatever happened to the skyship, the mystery of both it and its supposed hero only deepens.
