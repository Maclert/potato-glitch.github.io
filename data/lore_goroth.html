	<h4>One that Eats Humans</h4>
	<strong>Unlock at Lv10</strong>
	<br /><br />
	The first record of Goroth as a wanted man was found in the Crowded City Badaal. Most think he came from a town not far from there. A slow-moving, clumsy speaker, but not a malicious bone in his body.<br /><br />Yet still, he ate people. It didn't matter what time of day. When he was hungry, he'd gobble them to bits, leaving a dreadful sight throughout the city on a daily basis. He was neither beast nor man. He could speak in human tongue, yet human logic escaped him, as he swung his hammer around town from day to day.<br />Eventually he earned the title of 'Man Muncher,' terrifying passerbys on the street.<br /><br />Analysis traced this odd behavior of his back to birth. One theory proposes that he was created artificially by means of a special magic, with a body of research lending credence to it.<br />Researchers claim his idiosyncrasies don't stop at man-eating and incredible physical strength, but extend to a high level of magic, although he is clearly not a sorcerer.<br /><br />No one is certain why he was created in the first place. And his great misfortune may stem from the fact that his creator was not present upon his birth.<br />No one was there to teach him right from wrong, and he was thrown into the real world with nothing but ignorance, yet he had to survive.<br />Perhaps the only thing life had in store for Goroth was daily suffering, forcing him into a framework differing greatly from that of man.

	<h4>Pure Yet Cruel</h4>

	<br /><br />
	Goroth was pure at heart. So eating to stay alive was simply a survival instinct, as he had no concept of right or wrong.<br /><br />Goroth required a great deal of magic to move his body, and replenishing that magic required a great deal of eating. The best way to meet this goal was targeting humans, as he enjoyed eating human meat more than anything available at shops.<br /><br />One theory purports that Goroth chose his meals by prioritizing flavor over efficiency, and that he was even a gourmet of sorts in his own right.<br />He was very particular when choosing his favorites, and assumed to have a long list of likes and dislikes, but at a fundamental level. Goroth was aware of the nutritional value humans, beasts, and livestock could offer him. Killing to satisfy his hunger took top priority, and he most certainly walked the streets while dining.<br />At first, his activities were strictly limited to the outskirts of Badaal, but eventually he started working his way into other areas, cementing his reputation as a bloodthirsty killer throughout the world.<br /><br />Also, Goroth's actions were punctuated by childlike thinking. When pursued by soldiers for his killing deeds, he changed stomping grounds from Badaal to the port town of Granada, and started killing people there just because he "didn't like them".<br /><br />Since he is pure at heart, if even one person were to teach him right from wrong, he would probably absorb such basic ethics with an earnest mind, which could have very well prevented this tragic situation.<br />He most likely had the capacity to find food that was accepted within the moral framework of society. And if he was really able to live like this, Goroth could have experienced life free of the numerous activities that ultimately defined him in the end.

	<h4>Questionable Promise</h4>

	<br /><br />
	Records of Goroth's atrocious human-eating activities suddenly stopped appearing at a certain time.<br />Many theories are floating around even today as to what made him stop. Some claim he discovered something more delicious than human flesh, while others say he found a more efficient way to replenish his magic (yet to him it was all about filling up an empty stomach).<br /><br />Although there really is no clear answer as to why he stopped munching humans, the testimony of a certain man who interacted with him after he stopped his deviant eating habits sheds a bit of light on the subject. It is actually quite an interesting bit of history on Goroth.<br /><br />"I was out walking in the desert one day, and got caught in this wicked sandstorm, see?<br />I didn't even know which way was up in that mess, but I desperately wanted to get back to my town. Suddenly this unusual character, hammer in hand, appears right in front of me.<br />So I take a closer look and I knew right away, this guy was the Man Muncher everybody's so terrified of back in the city. Walking around in this sandstorm as exhausted as I was, I kind of accepted my fate, that this guy was gonna eat me soon, and my life was about to end right then and there.<br />But the Man Muncher didn't eat me. I told him I was lost out there, and this is what he said:<br />'I take you to city. When we get to city, you buy me meat.'<br />The meat he was talking about was regular meat you or I might buy at a restaurant. He had no interest in dining on my flesh whatsoever, so I had to ask him: Why aren't you eating humans?<br />And he says, 'I make promise.'<br />Not sure what he was talking about, but one thing for sure is that this guy helped me in my time of need. Although I did have to empty out my wallet paying for all that meat."

	<h4>Two Murderers</h4>

	Records of Goroth’s man-eating activities stopped appearing after a certain point in time, but this in no way meant he had stopped committing crimes. The records show that guards were still after him in all the areas he was recorded as eating and killing humans.<br /><br />There are eyewitness accounts on record of Goroth trying to flee from town after showing an intense craving for food. It’s not certain whether he had lost his zeal for eating, or if he was urgently searching for food to replenish the magic he requires to move, as a kind of defensive instinct.<br />Either way, people witnessed the deep sense of joy and satisfaction in his facial expressions while he was eating.<br /><br />Also, the records show that someone else was after Goroth in addition to guards. This mystery man was rumored to have been a bloodthirsty killer just like Goroth.<br />Although it is still unclear as to why exactly he was pursuing Goroth, there are many accounts of this mystery man challenging him to a fight.<br /><br />One of the many fights between them was interrupted by a scholar of magic and a woman. This fact was documented in the notes of the magic scholar himself, in which he claims the woman and he were after the other killer, and they happened to encounter Goroth.<br /><br />He states that the mystery killer moved fluidly as if dancing during this fight, while Goroth would clumsily spin his big body into his opponent with hammer in hand, noting that it was “truly a clash between soft and hard power.”<br /><br />This scholar’s written account of the incident is the only known material in existence that describes their fight in such detail.<br /><br />As to how the fight ended, no records have been found, so it remains a mystery to this day. Did Goroth win, or did the mystery man?<br />Or did it end in a tie?<br />Instead of pursuing the history of this fight, perhaps tracking down the areas he used to eat at would uncover more clues on his life.
