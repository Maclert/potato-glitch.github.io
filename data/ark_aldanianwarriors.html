	<h4>North and South: The Ruin God's Ambush</h4>
	<strong>Unlock at Lv2</strong>
	<br /><br />
	The Arden Border in the center of Aldana is a key location connecting north and south. To capture the Arden Border is to capture all of Aldana, or so the old saying goes. Accordingly, it has long been the site of many furious battles.<br />The most famous of these battles was when the humans intercepted and defended against the God of Ruin's followers.<br />The humans, including the hero Adel, and some of the Beasts rose up in defense; the followers of the God of Ruin, realizing that several countries had come together in an alliance, launched a campaign to eradicate the rebels.<br />They prepared a large army to attack Aldana from the south.<br />In response, the human side mobilized the armies of several countries, including the holy land of Odal, to rush to the border. If the border had fallen here, Aldana would have been invaded by the God of Ruin's faction.<br />And if that came to pass, then it is clear that the human and Beast factions would have lost the will to rebel, and would have once again been under the rule of the God of Ruin.<br /><br />Thus, both factions fought at the Arden Border.<br />The battle was particularly bloody. When the conflict began in the early morning, the God of Ruin's faction had the greater and stronger army, and held the advantage.<br />However, the tide turned when the human faction dispatched a splinter army from the border to flank the God of Ruin's forces. The battle lasted until evening and ended with the human faction triumphant. However, the faction suffered heavy losses and injury of over 80% of its soldiers. As a result, the survivors were known as the Soldiers of Arden and awarded enormous respect. Many records remain of their brave deeds, including the account of the soldier Evan, who became known as the next great hero after Adel.

	<h4>The White Knight Comes Calling: Dying Wishes</h4>
	<strong>Unlock at Lv4</strong>
	<br /><br />
	Records show that during the period when the hero Melza was known as the White Knight, she stopped by the border to fight. At the time, she was popular among the common folk, and bards often wrote of her deeds.<br />While these tales were somewhat exaggerated, they nonetheless ensured that Melza's deeds at the border are still widely known to this day.<br /><br />Melza and her party stopped at the Arden Border during a quest to subjugate the God of Ruin.<br />At the time, the Arden Border was ruled by Odal, which was still under the God of Ruin's dominion.<br />As a result, Melza's rebellion could by no means be openly supported. However, the occupying troops were sympathetic to Mleza's cause, and the feelings of the locals did not align with the mainland.<br />The citizens even held a welcoming banquet for Melza's party.<br /><br />During the banquet, however, an incident occurred: there came an urgent report that bandits had attacked a village near the Malboria Wetlands.<br />Melza immediately suggested a call to arms, with her own party fighting as well. At the time, the border was only lightly manned due to a changing of personnel. Mobilizing the troops without due caution could result in a counterattack.<br />When the commander in charge hesitated, Melza declared that they would go alone, and she headed to the village with two of her companions.<br />They attempted to stop her, as attacking the bandits with only three of them would be too risky, but Melza said this:<br /><br />“I decided to fight the God of Ruin in order to protect the weak. I am not about to let a village be overtaken by bandits.”<br /><br />By shaking off the concerns of the soldiers and heading to the village, Melza left a deep impression on them. Under the orders of their commander, the soldiers quickly followed after Melza to aid in protecting the village.<br /><br />...The minstrels' songs telling of Melza's actions at the border end on this high note. However, actual historical records show a further tragic development.<br /><br />As Melza continued on her quest, she would for some unknown reason eventually be converted to a follower of the God of Ruin, and come to display great resentment toward humanity.<br />At the time, however, the God of Ruin's followers harshly interrogated Odal about the Arden Border troops' cooperation with her.<br />In their rush to settle things, Odal attempted to sentence the entire garrison to death, but forestalling this, the commanding officer discharged his men. He claimed all responsibility, and in the end he was the only one executed.<br />The people of Arden hated Melza for her transformation and were enraged at Odal's unreasonable response.<br />However, the commander himself had said, “As a soldier tasked with protecting the people, I died the moment I hesitated to go help the village.<br />Melza was the one who saved them. If I am to lose my life, then so be it.”<br />To the very end, he would not voice a single word of resentment toward Melza nor the nation.

	<h4>For Independence: Anti-Odal Defense Force</h4>
	<strong>Unlock at Lv7</strong>
	<br /><br />
	Aldana was once a mere dominion of the Holy Odal Kingdom, but after the great war with the God of Ruin, it fought for its independence and built the foundations of the current empire.<br />The Arden Border was one of the stages upon which the war for independence was fought.<br /><br />The humans won the war against the God of Ruin and its kin, but the scars ran deep, and every country had to focus on their own revival.<br />At the same time, the Holy Odal Kingdom, boasting the largest territory on Granzelia, saw a decline in its nation's power and exploited its former territory more than ever before.<br />Though the destruction Aldana suffered in the war was just as great, the people were being squeezed more than ever.<br /><br />Radikal, hailing from the Aldana continent and formerly the captain of the kingdom's stationed garrison, spearheaded the troops making their way around each province. Radikal found that the people of Aldana could take no more, and decided to revolt against the kingdom.<br />The plan was to first occupy the Arden Border as a base.<br />Radikal was ready for the inevitable battle, but the soldiers of the border simply conceded to his determination.<br />The border was taken without a battle.<br /><br />Many of the soldiers stationed at the Arden Border were originally from the area, and every single one was saddened by the destruction of their homeland.<br />The news of rebel forces occupying Arden Border was quickly conveyed to the Holy Odal Kingdom, and a force to suppress the rebels was dispatched.<br />Radikal and his soldiers, holed up at the Arden Border, were under siege by the kingdom's forces.<br />But using the border's iron defenses—which had protected it until now—to hold off the invading forces was not so simple.<br /><br />As it became clear the battle would be drawn-out, there came an urgent report: Soleil, the son of the hero Adel, had raised an army independent of the Holy Odal Kingdom.<br />“The mighty Adel's son has raised an army…"<br />This statement had an incredible effect and a revolt broke out all over Aldana in response to Soleil's call to arms.<br />Radikal sensed that the kingdom's forces surrounding them were uneasy and took the opportunity to destroy them.<br />They rushed to Soleil's side, becoming a company in the rebel army.<br /><br />After Aldana gained autonomy, Radikal was hailed as a forerunner in the war for independence and selected as the commander-in-chief in charge of defending against Holy Odal Kingdom.<br />Aldana had never before seen such a low-ranked man become commander-in-chief.<br />It is said that when the country later became the base of the imperial government, this was what gave rise to the emphasis of ability over social standing.

	<h4>Genesis: The Heroes Are Born</h4>
	<strong>Unlock at Lv10</strong>
	<br /><br />
	The Arden Border was the stage for many battles, but its origins are not well understood.<br />The name 'Arden Border' first appears in history when the Holy Odal Kingdom's army eradicated tribes from all over Aldana and engulfed the continent, adding it to their territory.<br />A military inspector at the time wrote in his diary:<br />“There are troops stationed in a fort called Arden. We will rest here before renewing our attack on the south.”<br /><br />Thus, it was not the Holy Odal Kingdom that built this fort, but according to the military inspector's account, there were already fort-like structures before the invasion of the kingdom's army.<br />So, when was the Arden Fort established?<br />For what, and by whom?<br />There have been many scholars seeking to answer these questions, but not a one has been able to solve the mystery, and there are currently a great wealth of differing opinions among historians.<br />Some insist it was made by the gods to observe Aldana.<br />Others say that it was originally a discovery site for machinery and that it developed from there.<br />However, none of these theories are credible, and no evidence has been discovered.<br />Mysterious though it may be, we know one thing for certain aside from its origins: the fort is Aldana's stronghold, and that in itself has made it the focus of countless battles and given rise to many heroes. It was also the birthing ground of the Warriors of Arden.
