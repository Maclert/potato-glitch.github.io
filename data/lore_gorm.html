	<h4>Gorde Mines</h4>
	<strong>Unlock at Lv10</strong>
	<br /><br />
	"Gorm's Travel Log"<br /><br />My name is Gorm, prince of a nation considered poor and rural, located on the outskirts of the Holy Kingdom.<br />There is no denying my nation is poor, but our days of hunger and suffering are now behind us. For years, I've firmly believed we have veins of precious metals running through our land of Gord, researching ways to access them. And now, the research has finally paid off.<br /><br />My great people, I have discovered a mine full of valuable resources.<br />From this very moment, my kingdom has been blessed with immense wealth.<br />But rest assured, I would never limit these resources to my own personal gain. Royal assets are the nation's assets, meaning they belong to the people. I promise to turn our newly-found resources into capital and assets for you, the people of my nation.<br /><br />That's right. My first line of action is to change the mine's resources into gold and silver, to be distributed to all of you.<br />The aristocracy might have an issue with this, but it will not deter me. My people, you have lived a life of suffering, yet stayed loyal to my family, so it is my obligation to bring you out of poverty.<br />Oh people of Gord, I promise to protect you.<br /><br />Rumors of our mine discovery may quickly spread to other nations, so we must consider the possibility of invasion by those who wish to take our resources.<br />After dividing silver and gold among the people, the remaining wealth will be put into expanding our military armaments. We are surrounded by powerful enemies, along with a presence of bandits that cannot be ignored.<br /><br />But with I, Prince Gorm at the helm, and my miraculous discovery, we cannot lose. No matter how powerful the aggressors may be, I will guide our great soldiers to victory.<br />I hold the glory of our nation, and our people, in my hands.

	"Special Feature: A Visit to Gord"<br /><br />Today we offer an interview from a citizen of Gord Village, just several years after the so-called 'Miracle of Gord' took place, in which gold was discovered at the Gord Mines.<br />We talked with him about such topics as how their lives have changed, what they think of the charismatic Prince Gorm who first opened the mine, and other such things. Please enjoy:<br /><br />'When a person's environment changes, that person can change along with it in a number of ways.<br />This is what I've felt every day for the past few years. I hardly recognize our village since we came into money. But this isn't only because of the gold that's been thrown around to give us more things. That gold was used as capital so that everyone can work a job.<br /><br />One man further opened up the mine, while another one looked after the gold that came out of it. Then another one opened up this organization that's trying to restore our natural environment that died out from years of poverty.<br />So unlike the days of old when we scraped out a living just to survive, I feel like we're rich in spirit now, too. Using this gold as a means, the people of Gord can now think about how they wanna move forward, for a new way of life.<br /><br />And it's all thanks to Prince Gorm.<br />What kinda man is the prince? Well, to be frank, he's a man of style. He may dress up in gaudy outfits and what have you, but he don't mind getting his hands dirty or talking with the 'little people' like us.<br />After he found those veins, I reckon he could've kept that gold all to himself. But the prince don't think like that. Instead he went against the retainer's will and took the lead in getting that gold to his people.<br />Now that's a man of royalty you don't see too much.<br /><br />I heard he took a lot of heat from others in the aristocracy, or been blamed for kissing up to the people and whatnot, but I don't think that at all, and I can speak for the people in general.<br />He's the king of kings in my book.<br />We want a prince who's not afraid to bust his butt up in the mountains to do what's best for the people.'

	<h4>The Bandit</h4>
	<strong>Unlock at Lv50</strong>
	<br /><br />
	"Gorm's Travel Log"<br /><br />I have my nation's interests at heart. Which is another way of saying I care about my people.<br />And I welcome those who feel the same, no matter who they might be. But that bandit is a different story altogether.<br /><br />Of course, I've heard rumors of him passing out his stolen goods to the poor. And if that's what he's all about, I might think differently of his operation.<br /><br />But he is obviously lining his own pockets with the riches he finds. It's an undisputed fact that he keeps much more wealth for himself than the scraps he hands out to the people. And when I first realized this, I sunk into despair like you couldn't imagine.<br /><br />I still remember it to this day. The first time he came to my castle, and stole from my treasure room.<br /><br />A strong wind was blowing in from the Gord Mines on that night. I was patrolling the area to express my gratitude to the men working hard for their country. And when I got to the door of my treasure room, I found two guards sleeping there.<br /><br />When I shook them awake in a panic, and asked what happened, one suddenly became drowsy and fell unconscious. The other claimed he was attacked by a bandit. He said that we may have been robbed, so I opened the treasure room door to check inside.<br />Thankfully nothing seemed out of place, so I turned around to tell the guard everything was fine.<br />Just then, the man who was dressed as a guard now looked quite suspicious, with a cape fluttering in the wind.<br /><br />This was the very bandit who's been a thorn in my side ever since. He'd planned it from the start, to cause this panic and get me to open the treasure room door in haste.<br /><br />After effortlessly taking my treasure through the open door, he then vanished into darkness with the raging wind. How foolish of me, for I'd helped him rob me blind before my very eyes.<br /><br />This was the moment we were connected by fate. And from that day onward, he has stolen from me on numerous occasions. Truly a long succession of losses for me. But next time, I promise you he will face my wrath, and he shall be thrown into a cold, unforgiving prison cell for the rest of his days.

	<h4>The Prince's Change</h4>
	<strong>Unlock at Lv80</strong>
	<br /><br />
	"Special Feature: A Visit to Gorde"<br /><br />A few years have already passed since the last Special Feature. Gourd Village is as prosperous as ever thanks to the local mining industry. However, the one started it all, Prince Gorm, is nowhere to be seen.<br />What happened to him?<br />Here's what one villager told us:<br /><br />"I can't remember when he first started traveling abroad... Oh, right! There was a big fuss about a thief stealing a 'huge prison' or something, and it was just after that.<br /><br />Between you and me, he's been acting pretty weird lately. I heard his servants talking one time, and apparently the prince has been making a habit of hanging out in ancient ruins.<br /><br />And he's been bringing back things he finds there that he likes. Apparently some of these things are amazing objects that commoners like us wouldn't understand. The prince might not look like it, but he has studied a lot of different things, so he'd know.<br /><br />He'll be able to turn whatever he finds into something to help the whole country. We all trust him to do that.<br />It does strike me as a little weird how he's so into these old ruins, though..."<br /><br />The prince's behavior has only grown even stranger since we spoke with the Gourd villager.<br /><br />Our dedicated investigative efforts have enabled us to gain access to the objects from the ruins and also permission to tell you about them here.<br /><br />The objects were unlike anything we'd ever seen before and could not be identified. Some appear to be parts of something bigger. Others are small stones that give off light. Still others resembled bones of some sort.<br /><br />We asked the prince to explain their significance to us. However, he evaded our questions and wouldn't give a direct answer.<br />Then we demanded that he at least explain how he came across them in the ruins. To this he gave only the following vague response.<br /><br />"I was told I should bring them back because the ruins were getting dirty..."<br /><br />That's all he would share, implying that someone was telling him what to do. It's anyone guess whether his discoveries will prove beneficial for the country or not.
