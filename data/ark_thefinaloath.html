	<h4>A Maiden's Armor</h4>
	<strong>Unlock at Lv2</strong>
	<br /><br />
	The Holy Armor Eidel is said to have a will of its own, selecting its wearer and conferring them legendary power. Though this set of armor has long fascinated the cognoscenti, it quickly rose to general prominence when worn by the female knight Maddine of the Holy Kingdom Odal.<br /><br />Maddine became a knight to avenge her father, and the Holy Armor Eidel would appear before her to grant her the requisite power. In her suit of armor, Maddine slew many monsters until eventually exacting revenge.<br /><br />Other historical figures – the fame of whom is admittedly eclipsed by Maddine – are said to have also worn the armor in battle. But all these young maidens were earnestly pursuing their wishes, or were facing a moment of crisis when Eidel came to them. After listening to their wishes and confirming the purity of their hearts, the set of armor encourages the women to try it on.<br /><br />The knight Maddine is said to have discovered Eidel in the treasure vault under the Great Cathedral in Odal’s royal capital; tales of the suit of armor can be found, however, throughout Granzelia – from Aldana to Lanzelia. Surveys continue in underground vaults where Maddine discovered the armor, but nothing has been discovered thus far.

	<h4>A Nun's Battle</h4>
	<strong>Unlock at Lv4</strong>
	<br /><br />
	The following tale does not involve the knight Maddine but, rather, Holy Armor Eidel.<br /><br />In the period immediately following humanity’s great war against the God of Ruin, the lands of Granzelia were ravaged by chaos, and lawless bandits reigned. The Kingdom of Lanzelia was no exception, and despite leaders’ best efforts, reconstruction and law enforcement stagnated.<br /><br />It once came to pass that after fleeing a company of knights, a group of bandits broke into a local orphanage. One of the nuns working there tried to comfort the frightened children while praying the bandits would leave. It was then that she heard the bandits whispering that they would kill everyone in the orphanage.<br /><br />“I beg you… at least let the children go…”<br /><br />The nun mouthed a silent prayer, and soon after she heard her name being voiced – a response no others seemed able to hear.  The nun tried to move toward the source of the voice without arousing the bandits’ attention when she discovered a mysterious basement entrance she’d never noticed before.<br />Shaking with fear as she made her way through, she saw before her a suit of armor exuding a divine aura. As the nun repeated her wish to free the children, the armor urged her to put it on. After doing so, the nun felt a rush of power well up within her.<br /><br />Thereafter, the nun, who had never so much as picked up a sword in her life, engaged the bandits in combat with the skill of a champion. After that, the nun took off her armor and headed to the nearest military encampment to inform the garrison, but when she returned the armor had disappeared without a trace, and the basement entrance that should have been there was gone.

	<h4>The Two Shield-maidens</h4>
	<strong>Unlock at Lv7</strong>
	<br /><br />
	According to tradition, the Holy Armor Eidel has its genesis in the ancient days of myth. In a time before history there lived a pair of twin shield-maidens, the elder named Lafira, and the younger named Eidel. The pair served a goddess of tremendous power, and at her command would defeat many Beasts who crossed the gods and their agents.<br /><br />Once at the order of the goddess, the two sisters struck out to slay a Beast. However, it was surprisingly strong, and the two sisters struggled to subdue it. As the Beast bore down upon her, Eidel could not sync her breath with her sister Lafira to attack in unison.<br />The creature attacked the panicked shield-maiden mercilessly. In a moment of crisis, Lafira forced herself between her younger sister and the monster to block its attacks with her body.<br />“Hang in there, Eidel!” cried Lafira to reassure her sister and encourage her to attack again.<br /><br />Eidel, regaining her senses, adjusted her breathing to match her elder sister’s and the two soon succeeded in subjugating the monster. Fortunately, the wounds Lafira sustained while protecting Eidel did not cut deep, and Lafira told her sister not to worry.<br /><br />Yet after they returned home, Eidel continued to be troubled. Her fighting ability was not far beneath that of her older sister, but she often hesitated during critical moments in battle on account of her gentle disposition unbefitting of a shield-maiden.<br /><br />Eidel feared that at their current rate, her older sister may end up sacrificing herself. But as Eidel thought upon her quandary, a new idea suddenly came to her.

	<h4>Eidel's Wish</h4>
	<strong>Unlock at Lv10</strong>
	<br /><br />
	Eventually a great battle broke out between the gods, precipitating a schism in the Divine Realm that was so great some whispered it could end the world. Having resolved to join as shield-maidens on behalf of the goddess, the twin sisters Lafira and Eidel expected a challenge much fiercer than that provided by Beasts. Eidel therefore entreated the goddess,<br />“O my Lady, I beg of you, allow me to be the armor protecting my sister.”<br /><br />Lafira was shocked. She pleaded with her sister to cease her foolishness, but – hearing Eidel’s plea – the goddess entreated Lafira to accepted her sister’s gesture of love. She then asked Eidel once more,<br />“Is this your heart’s true wish?”<br /><br />Eidel nodded as if to say yes. Having seen that her resolve was firm, the goddess transformed her into a powerful suit of holy armor. Lafira soon equipped it and followed her mistress into the fray. The ensuing battle claimed many a god, but not Lafira – protected by the veritable wall of steel that was Eidel, she displayed her valor through the battle’s very end.<br /><br />Lauded by the goddess, Lafira expressed her sincere wish that her sister be restored to her original form. Naturally, the goddess agreed and raised a hand to revert her. Yet Eidel refused.<br />“Normally I am powerless, but as armor I could protect my sister. Please suffer me to remain in this form so I may lend this strength to any despairing maiden.”<br /><br />The goddess, sympathetic to Eidel, conferred her the power to appear to those in need of strength. Lafira, realizing that her sister would not be dissuaded, gifted her the Sacred Stallion Feltiel – and allowed her to summon it at will.<br />“Farewell, my dear sister Eidel… you have chosen your path. Do as your heart wills. I hope only that your name comes to inspire hope in the maidens of the world who need your power.”
