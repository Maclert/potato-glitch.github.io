	<h4>A Curious Encounter</h4>
	<strong>Unlock at Lv2</strong>
	<br /><br />
	Heaven’s Bow Star-Lord… Belonging to a forest-dwelling tribe, this holy bow has been used to exterminate monsters for generations.<br />Its name first became known to outsiders before the war with the God of Ruin, when a demi-human woman named Feda visited a village by the Woods of Midra. Seeking shelter to recover from her long journey, Feda obliged the invitation of the young boy she met, and rested at his home. As a young orphan living alone in a corner of the village, the boy begged Feda for tales of the outside world.<br />Feda was happy to respond with stories of every land she had passed through on her travels.<br />The boy seemed most excited by one about ancient ruins and the machines left behind.<br /><br />After a few days, Feda was fully recovered, so she went to bid the boy farewell before continuing her journey. But that morning, a monster attacked the village.<br />Feda darted past villagers who were deliberating over where to flee, and faced the monster with her trusty Heaven’s Bow Star-Lord.<br />She drew the bowstring with all her strength, released, and took the monster down with one arrow.<br />The villagers were delighted to have been saved, and thanked Feda profusely, but something seemed off. When she asked, the villagers told her that the village had a rule: those who arrived from the outside must leave at once.<br />And so, they asked the same of her.<br /><br />“Well, a rule’s a rule…”<br /><br />Feda was planning to leave anyway, so she acquiesced.<br />But there was one problem.<br />When the villagers found out that the boy Feda met had allowed her to stay, they demanded he leave too for breaking the rule. Feeling somewhat at fault, Feda invited the boy to travel alongside her.<br />The boy had long dreamed of seeing the outside world, so he jumped at the chance.<br />And so, the two would go on to roam the lands together.

	<h4>Trial of the Holy Bow</h4>
	<strong>Unlock at Lv4</strong>
	<br /><br />
	Heaven’s Bow Star-Lord is a gold-trimmed thing of beauty, but its aesthetics belie its awesome power. When wielded by tribes who live among nature, the arrows it fires can fell gods.<br />It’s been unclear as to how a demi-human who appeared in a secluded village acquired this bow, but recent research has finally shed some light onto this mystery.<br /><br />The Star-Lord was originally kept safe deep in the ruins inside a Malborian forest, where the inhabitants worshipped it as a communal treasure. Many dreamed of laying their hands on this bow, of course, but doing so required one to prove their strength by clearing brutal trials set by the tribe, and defeating the ruins’ guardian spirit.<br />Almost none could.<br />A young demi-human living in the Malborian forest named Feda also dreamed of that bow, and thus pursued archery with a passion.<br /><br />When she was 16 years old, Feda underwent the trials to obtain the Star-Lord. She completed the tribal portion with ease, but the guardian spirit proved to be tougher than expected. Feda fired countless arrows, but the spirit avoided them all as it closed in on her and attacked.<br />It was all Feda could do to maintain a distance where she could still dodge and counterattack.<br /><br />“I can’t win by running away. I’ve gotta try something else…”<br /><br />Exhausted, Feda chose to bet it all on a last-ditch effort. She’d give up all attempts at dodging and fire one arrow with what little strength she had left.<br />Perhaps sensing her desperation, the spirit quickly closed in. It attacked her shoulders, legs, face, and everywhere else, but Feda was still standing. And when the spirit – now at point-blank range – went in for the kill, Feda let loose the most forceful arrow she could.<br /><br />The spirit’s attack and Feda’s shot… Both seemed to land at the same time, but Feda’s arrow struck the spirit’s chest just a hair sooner, causing it to vanish into thin air.<br />Thus, Feda proved her strength to the guardian spirit and earned the right to obtain Heaven’s Bow Star-Lord.

	<h4>The Serpent Strikes</h4>
	<strong>Unlock at Lv7</strong>
	<br /><br />
	After obtaining the Star-Lord and leaving her homeland, Feda traveled the world and used her bow to help the people she met. The Heaven’s Bow has but one rule for its owner: those who obtain its great power must use it for good.<br />By this time, Feda may have gained a travel companion, but that duty hadn’t changed. She protected that boy as she shot down the monsters that would do humans harm.<br /><br />On their journey, Feda heard of a giant serpentine monster that attacked people near the Moriana Plateau and set off to hunt it. At a village near Moriana, she heard that not only was this monster harming people, but it was threatening to widen its rampage unless it was given tributes and sacrifices.<br /><br />“Tributes and… sacrifices?!<br />How dare a mere Beast demand such a thing!”<br /><br />Feda made no attempt to conceal her fury, but above all else, she and her Star-Lord were monster-vanquishing virtuosos. She didn’t let her emotions get the best of her and instead crafted a plan.<br />She asked the villagers to prepare an ostentatious tribute while she played the role of the sacrificial village girl to catch the monster off guard.<br />Soon, the serpent appeared before her to inspect its offerings. Seemingly pleased with its tribute, it turned to the sacrifice… that is, Feda. Feda measured the distance as the monster approached, and at just the right moment, she fired a lethal arrow from the Heaven’s Bow she’d hidden under her cloak.<br />The arrow hit its mark right between the serpent’s eyes. Dealt with a fatal blow, the serpent died on the spot… or so it seemed, until the monster attacked Feda despite having its cranium pierced.<br /><br />“Guh… This can’t be! How in the world…?”<br /><br />Feda’s momentary surprise was enough for the serpent to land a hit on her. But she regained her composure and fired a second shot, then a third, each causing visible damage.<br />Having no choice but to bear every blow, the serpent eventually collapsed, this time for good.<br />Feda breathed a sigh of relief and went to check the body to make sure, but surprisingly, the serpent still had this to say:<br /><br />“It may not be now… but I hope you look forward to what you’ll see two or three years down the line.”<br /><br />With that, the serpent finally lost consciousness.<br />Feda took those words as a worrying sign, but for now, went back to the village to tell them that the slaughter had been a success. She then rejoined the boy and the two of them continued their journey.<br /><br />It would not be until some time later that she understood what the serpent meant…

	<h4>A Task Entrusted</h4>
	<strong>Unlock at Lv10</strong>
	<br /><br />
	After felling the serpent, Feda continued to exterminate monsters as she traveled the world with the boy.<br />But one day, while wandering the Mordana continent, she left a letter and the Heaven’s Bow with the boy and vanished.<br />All that was written in the letter was this: “I leave the Star-Lord to you.”<br /><br />It’s still a mystery as to why Feda disappeared. But people who saw her battle firsthand noted that her movements at times seemed sluggish and stiff.<br />A popular theory among researchers suggests her consecutive battling had brought her to her limit.<br /><br />The boy, now all alone, made no attempt to search for Feda.<br />He read the letter and simply understood.<br />He gripped the Star-Lord firmly.<br />He had spent so long watching Feda fight that he knew her archery techniques like the back of his hand. The boy went on to take up the mantle and continue battling with the Star-Lord.<br />He felled many monsters throughout the land.<br />And just like Feda, he stopped battling one day and disappeared without a trace.<br />His whereabouts are currently unknown, with some suggesting he lost his life during his travels.<br /><br />But even though the boy vanished, the Heaven’s Bow itself did not stay gone for long.<br />The Star-Lord appeared in the ruins where it was first worshipped, cradled by a stone statue that looks suspiciously similar to Feda.<br /><br />Many historians imagine that the boy who succeeded Feda would have made quite the mark during the war with the God of Ruin, had he participated.<br />However, one particularly bold theory has visible supporters: it posits that the mysterious archer Phal, who suddenly appeared with a crossbow, might have actually been the boy.<br />The genders don’t match, of course, and the feel of her trusty crossbow must have been wildly different from the Star-Lord, so it’s far from being taken seriously.<br />That said, it’s not uncommon for a prepubescent girl to pass herself off as a boy for the sake of traveling, and the boy’s name sounded suspiciously close to “Phal” when pronounced by the tribe Feda belonged to.<br />This theory is by all means a minority view, but the few who support it do so ardently.
