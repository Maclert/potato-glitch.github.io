	<h4>The Mysterious Magic Scholar</h4>
	<strong>Unlock at Lv2</strong>
	<br /><br />
	There once was a magic scholar named Yohan.<br />He was known for his drooping, sleepy eyes, which made him seem like a bit of a dunce. His research as a magic scholar was not very valued at the time, as none of his findings were particularly outstanding. His personal history isn’t very well-known either.<br />So why is he still talked about now, eons later?<br />That would be because of the research found in his secret laboratory – colloquially referred to as the Secret Room of the Hermit – after his death.<br />During Yohan’s lifetime, he told no one of this laboratory’s existence, and would hide away there to immerse himself in his research. Once the lab was discovered, the fruits of his research were closely guarded.<br /><br />Afterward, a struggle over the preservation of his documents ensued, and unfortunately, his research materials were rendered incomplete. As a result, while the laboratory itself is known to exist, its precise location has been lost to time.<br /><br />Let us take this time to clarify exactly what happened in this laboratory, and what the magic scholar Yohan accomplished, using the documents related to the laboratory and the few notes left by the researcher himself.<br />On the next page, we will read some of his very own words.

	<h4>An Unconvincing Memento</h4>

	“Why did I become a magic scholar? The reason is quite simple.<br />I’m not good at moving my body, so I made up for it by using my mind, which brought me to where I am now. Simple as that.<br />I do like to walk, though.<br />I feel happy just walking and spending time in nature.<br />It’s pure bliss.<br />Don’t tell anyone, but sometimes during my walks, nature gives me hints for my research.<br />Huh? You haven’t seen any nature-related research from me?<br />Teehee, that’s because I’ve got zero interest in publishing it. I’m satisfied as long as I can verify my own hypothesis in my lab.<br />It’s a pain to interact with other scholars. I just want to spend my time in peace, surrounded by nature. Research is nothing but a means to that end.”<br /><br />This is an excerpt from a conversation one of Yohan’s few friends had with him and recorded on a whim. On first glance, it seems to be a silly conversation with an oaf, but the account actually provides several hints as to the subject matter of his research, with words like “nature” and “lab”.<br /><br />Yohan would later meet his end without publishing any of his breakthroughs. His close friends, who sorted through his belongings after his death, had more questions than answers.<br />There seemed to be far too few documents relating to magic research.

	<h4>The Hidden Laboratory</h4>

	In life, Yohan was not very proactive with his research or the publishing thereof. However, he had to do at least a minimum amount of both if he wanted to eat.<br />Thus, it is possible to add “Cause of death: Starvation from lack of work” to his ever-growing list of shame. That aside, some of his acquaintances had their doubts about his behavior and began to investigate.<br /><br />What they learned was that Yohan had been conducting research in secret. According to their investigation, his lab was in a secluded, remote area, as if it were hiding something. Upon learning its location, they rushed out in a quest to find it.<br /><br />At the end of their long journey, they reached the laboratory Yohan had kept concealed during his lifetime. It was overflowing with research materials: maps plotting out dubious distributions, labware filled with preserved plants, and books stacked so high that a ladder would be required to reach the top.<br />The acquaintances parsed all of the research documents Yohan had left behind, and published them under his name.<br /><br />His research revolved around magic that utilized the power of nature, ranging from illness-curing magic to magical defense against household insects and toxins. While it may sound like Yohan was simply recreating common defense magic, this was not the case.<br />In stark contrast to what his lazy appearance would have you believe, Yohan was exceptionally thorough with his experiments, adjusting each variable little by little until he had repeated each experiment thousands of times. As a result, his magic was many times more effective than conventional magic.<br /><br />Normally, this sheer number of iterations would take an unfeasible amount of time, which means Yohan must’ve spent the majority of his life conducting these experiments – according to his acquaintances, at least.

	<h4>Scholar's Wish</h4>

	<br /><br />
	The reason Yohan was able to immerse himself so deeply into his research was probably his insatiable desire to, as he himself said, “spend time in nature”.<br />He supposedly thought that he could build a stronger relationship with nature by cultivating a better understanding of it through magic.<br />But then why did he not publish his research? There are several different theories.<br /><br />One theory is that he did not like his magic scholar colleagues, and thus wanted to construct a world all his own.<br />Proponents of this theory state that he pursued the research only for himself and wanted to keep it that way.<br />Perhaps he could only conduct his nature research in a completely silent space.<br /><br />Another theory posits that his conducting research behind closed doors showed he was, in fact, interested in publishing it. Those who favor this theory state that he simply passed away before he felt he was ready to publish his results.<br />In any case, the fact is that his acquaintances who had compiled and published the research after his death had a remarkably easy time doing so, “as if he had written everything with the intent of explaining it to someone else.”<br /><br />Yet another theory argues that Yohan simply got caught up in some sort of incident before he could publish his research.<br />This theory’s supporters claim that not that he was a concerned party in the incident, but rather that he was collateral damage, and as his time was cut short, he was unable to publish his research.<br /><br />Regardless, if Yohan was a genuine nature lover, then it would not be strange at all for him to try and publish his research to inspire others to deepen their relationships with nature.
