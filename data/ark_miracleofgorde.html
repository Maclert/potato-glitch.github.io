	<h4>Farewell to Poverty</h4>
	<strong>Unlock at Lv2</strong>
	<br /><br />
	There once was a miracle that took place on a mountain which, at the time, was detested as a harmful volcano.<br />People came to call it the Miracle of Gorde.<br />In order to shed light upon what happened during this miracle, let us examine some documents left by our Gorde Village data collection party.<br /><br />Gorde Village was an ancient, desolate settlement in a small nation on the outskirts of the Holy Odal Kingdom.<br />The state that ruled the village no longer exists, making it difficult to trace the history. However, after many years of investigation, we successfully tracked down a portion of this nation’s royal records.<br /><br />Even the royal records deemed Gorde Village an infertile land incapable of yielding crops.<br />It was located on a remote island, avoided by everyone except for its residents and the philanthropists who offered aid. To add insult to injury, there was a volcano on the north-west portion of the island which threatened to erupt at any moment. The volcano was universally feared by the villagers.<br /><br />However, according to the royal records, the prince did not feel the situation in Gorde Village was unfavorable. In fact, he is quoted in the records as being quite optimistic about the matter.<br /><br />“Citizens! That mountain is the key to prosperity for not only the village, but our entire nation as well!”<br /><br />We can only assume that this statement befuddled the people at the time. However, the record continues with the following statement:<br /><br />“There is gold sleeping within Gorde Mountain. I hereby swear to find that gold and bestow wealth upon you all!”

	<h4>A Prince's Faith</h4>
	<strong>Unlock at Lv4</strong>
	<br /><br />
	The royal records of the small nation that governed Gorde Village state that the prince began excavating the mountain under the assumption that gold lay below. His habitual boldness had earned him the reputation of being prone to erroneous beliefs.<br />In any case, he was a hard worker whose forward-facing attention to detail was apparently unprecedented. (In fact, he would boast in the royal record: “There is no prince in the realm who sweats as much for his people as I sweat for mine.”)<br /><br />Ever inquisitive, the prince continued to research the mountain’s geological features, never once doubting that there was gold in Gorde Mountain.<br />As he was a prince, albeit one who governed a small nation, it might be hard to imagine he would personally engage in the excavation of a mountain. But his mantra was “A royal family is nothing if they do not share in the suffering of their people”, and thus he personally took charge of the project.<br />(Though he was clearly lying when he said, “I swung around a sixty-pound pickaxe all day today!”)<br />Even though the village was poor and desolate, most citizens did not dislike the prince, and were in fact charmed by him.<br /><br />Even after copious digging, however, there was still no gold to be found, so the excavation crew’s morale plummeted. Assured of his own scientific findings, the prince paid out of his own pocket for the crew’s food and drink, preserving morale so that the project could continue.<br />This act is thought to be based upon the prince’s oft-repeated mantra that “The king’s fortune is the kingdom’s fortune”.<br />He never spent his fortune for self-indulgence, and instead preferred to use his wealth for the good of the nation. It is thought that the excavation crew continued their seemingly endless dig because they earnestly believed that the prince would not hoard all the gold to himself.

	<h4>A Miraculous Moment</h4>

	<br /><br />
	The royal records detailed the excavation’s numerous failures. But not once did the prince ever give up, nor did he despair. In fact, he was almost frighteningly calm in his analyses of why things weren’t working out.<br />He recorded in great detail how he would inspect the composition of the excavated rock, and ceaselessly reselect digging sites to find places more likely to yield gold. His mining knowledge and techniques are still used to this day, and his keen eye is highly esteemed.<br />Eventually, his project finally bore fruit.<br /><br />One day, the excavated rock started to show signs of change. They were now finding a fine golden powder mixed into the rock, and thus the prince was convinced that they had finally found the lode of gold.<br />With newfound motivation, he continued to swing his pickaxe. (This tool had inexplicably increased in mass to over a hundred pounds, according to the prince.)<br />Below is an excerpt lifted straight from the royal records describing the event.<br /><br />“As if impressed by my presence, the people began putting more effort into the excavation. It was at that moment we formed a strong bond – one beyond that of royalty and subjects.<br />And finally, as if the very earth had yielded to our spirit, the next strike of my pickaxe had a different sort of give to it…”<br /><br />The prince’s description is as exaggerated as always, but we can extrapolate a more objective depiction of his actions here.<br />Since he had noticed a difference in texture, he became more careful with his pickaxe swings, and the hard sensation of his pickaxe hitting the rock gradually subsided.<br />The prince had finally found gold.

	This portion of the royal record jumps to the events following the discovery of gold. Gorde Mountain was renamed the Gorde Mines and became a site of gold excavation.<br /><br />However, it would later be determined that the lode of gold discovered by the prince was apparently the only one of its kind in that stratum of rock; thus, the miners had to try digging deeper and deeper.<br />The people deemed it a miracle that the prince had found gold at all, and they eventually began calling the discovery the Miracle of Gorde.<br />However, according to the royal records, the prince was quite annoyed that it had been called a miracle.<br /><br />“The lode’s discovery was a miracle?<br />What are you talking about?<br />The discovery was a result of my scientific calculations, my leadership, and the tireless work of the citizens who believed in me. It was the natural result of effort, not some miracle!<br />…But if the word “miracle” can be of strength to the poor citizens who have lost hope in themselves, then I suppose it’s not that bad.”<br /><br />After this entry, he too went on to call it the Miracle of Gorde.<br />Be it a miracle or an inevitability, the truth of the matter is that it quickly transformed the poor Gorde Village into a bustling town, and the prince gained fortune and fame.
