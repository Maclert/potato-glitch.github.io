	<h4>Determination</h4>
	<strong>Unlock at Lv10</strong>
	<br /><br />
	There once was a female knight in the Holy Kingdom Odal who fought wearing a holy suit of armor.<br />Born into a family of knights, Maddine's parents raised her to be a proper lady. In her childhood, she seemed like she'd meet their ideals. But when she met a pirate who saved her father from a sea monster, her own ideals took shape.<br /><br />"When I grow up, I wanna be just like that man!"<br /><br />Seeing that pirate dole out his own brand of justice left an impression on Maddine's young heart. She wanted to live like he did.<br />Maddine's father tried all he could to set her straight, but she made no effort to change her dreams for his sake. She didn't quite grow to choose the life of piracy, of course. Instead, she chose the life of knighthood like her father.<br />Perhaps because the path her father took crossed with that of the pirate ship she so admired, Maddine's father was initially against her wish to become a knight, but it was difficult to oppose the idea of his child following in his footsteps.<br /><br />But one day, when Maddine's father was returning home from a mission, he was attacked by an unknown assailant and lost his life. The fatal blow her father received didn't come from a monster's claws â€” it was a single stab in the back.<br />Maddine judged from how clean the wound was that it must have been a fellow knight. Maddine dried her tears and made a resolution: she would enter the Knights of Odal and find out who her father's killer was. She wanted to be a knight to begin with, but this vow turned a simple wish into her life's purpose.<br /><br />"Whoever killed my father, you won't get away with this!"<br /><br />Unfortunately, Maddine was quick to discover that the entrance exam for the Knights of Odal was far more difficult than she expected. it turned out that the basic techniques she had learned from her father all barely met the levels of a beginner. She failed the exam time and time again.<br />That's not to say Maddine had been lax in her training, of course. But her lack of any exceptional talent or combat experience left a substantial gap between her and the other applicants.<br /><br />Will I never become a knight? Will I never find my father's killer?<br /><br />Such desperate thoughts ran through Maddine's increasingly anxious mind until, late one night, she heard someone call her name. Not one that spoke to her ears, but one that spoke to her heart.<br />Maddine followed the voice to find a storage room hidden underneath a church. There lay a magnificent suit of armor enveloped in a brilliant light.

	Faced with this magnificent suit of armor enveloped in a brilliant light, Maddine slowly reached out her hand. When her fingers laid upon its plate, she heard the voice that had been calling to her clearer than ever.<br /><br />"Please, tell me more... What is the salvation that you seek?"<br /><br />Mysteriously, the armor's words made Maddine unafraid to lay her feelings bare. She told the armor everything about how her father was killed, and how she didn't have the skills to join the knights and find the killer. When the armor had heard everything, it shone even more brilliantly.<br /><br />"I accept your goals. I am the Holy Armor Eidel... By all means, put me on your body. I will be the strength that you need."<br /><br />Maddine was confused, but she did what the armor said and put it on. She immediately felt strength flow through her body ina  way she had never before experienced.<br /><br />"My goodness... what power!"<br /><br />With the armor named Eidel equipped, Maddine took the next entrance exam, and passed with flying colors. She was now a full-fledged Knight of Odal. Despite her earlier frustrations, Maddine's dream had finally come true. But instead of relief, she felt the pangs of guilt over what she had done.<br /><br />"How... can I be so cowardly? <br />I know I must find my father's murderer, but that's no excuse for relying on this armor's... Eidel's power in place of my own..."<br /><br />From that day forth, the weight on her conscience made Maddine push herself further than she ever had before. Her daily training regimen exceeded what even veteran knights underwent in both frequency and intensity.<br />She felt she had a duty to, if nothing else, become a skilled enough knight to be worthy of bearing the Holy Armor Eidel.

	<br /><br />
	Now a knight of the Holy Kingdom Odal, Maddine took on many missions to hunt monsters and capture criminals while wearing the Holy Armor Eidel.<br /><br />The knight captain Daftel, a friend of Maddine's late father, did everything he could to assist her in her search for his killer. However, he never played favorites, and always treated her as he would any other knight.<br />Fortunately, this proved to aid in Maddine's growth. Her intense training and her numerous combat experiences rapidly sharpened her skills. After little more than a year, Maddine became skilled enough to serve as a captain herself. Despite her perfectionist tendencies, her skill and character made her irrefutably worthy of the Holy Armor Eidel.<br /><br />"I can finally accomplish missions with a bit more ease now... but I still have so much to learn. I'm nowhere near the person that my father or that pirate were."<br /><br />Maddine searched for her father's killer between her knightly duties, but she didn't quite have the explosive progress here that she did elsewhere. She was never the type of person to be capable of focusing on two completely different goals at the same time.<br />But once she became a captain, she sometimes felt as though someone was watching her. At first she thought it might have been an accomplice of one of the many criminals she apprehended, but she realized it had to have been a fellow knight when she felt it inside the barracks.<br />She soon wondered if the gaze belonged to her father's killer.<br /><br />One day, Daftel gave Maddine a mission to defeat a monster that had suddenly appeared. The beast was incredibly powerful, to the point where Maddine might not be able to win even with the Holy Armor Eidel. To make matters worse, Maddine's squad was the only one that could be deployed.<br />Maddine brought her knights to face the beast in a battle she knew she might not return from. The monster was even stronger than she imagined. Maddine and her knights struggled hard and incurred dire wounds.<br />But the tables turned when a lucky strike of Maddine's spear pierced one of the monster's vital organs. Her entire squad went on the offensive and eventually succeeded in felling the beast. While the rest of her squad basked in the glory of their victory, Maddine walked away to find a spot to sit down.<br />And as she did, someone snuck up right behind her.

	Exhausted from her narrow victory against the monster, Maddine didn't notice the person sneaking up behind her. But the Holy Armor Eidel did.<br /><br />"Maddine, behind you!"<br /><br />Eidel's warning snapped Maddine back into action as she narrowly managed to block her assailant's blow with her shield. But when she saw the face of her attacker, she was stunned. It was none other than her late father's friend, the knight captain who ordered her on this monster hunt: Daftel.<br /><br />"What? But... why?"<br /><br />Daftel could see that although Maddine blocked his attack, she could still barely stand. Assured of his victory, he sneered and revealed that he had killed her father.<br />He had been selling top-secret intelligence to the God of Ruin's followers. The Holy Kingdom Odal had sworn fealty to the God of Ruin, but that didn't mean they had put all their cards on the table. Selling state secrets, even to the God of Ruin's followers, was considered by the kingdom to be an act of treason.<br />Maddine's father had tried to reason with Daftel when he learned of his crimes, but Daftel had felt he had no choice but to kill him to cover up his actions.<br /><br />Maddine was face-to-face with the killer she had sought for years. But after being so thoroughly spent by her battle with the monster, she had nowhere near the strength to fight him. It was all she could do to dodge Daftel's deadly blows.<br /><br />"Will I meet the same fate my father did at the hands of this man?"<br />Maddine was on the verge of giving up when she heard a voice in her heart.<br /><br />"Fight, Maddine! I'll give you all the power left in me!"<br />It was the voice of the Holy Armor Eidel. At once, the Holy Armor suddenly emitted a flash. Maddine felt her energy returning. Now that she had the strength to fight back, she firmly deflected Daftel's attack. She thrust her spear forth with all of the might she could muster.<br /><br />"Take this!"<br />The single blow struck Daftel clean in the chest. It was more than enough to end his life.<br /><br />After returning to the capital, Maddine reported Daftel's deeds to the king. His room provided plenty of evidence to prove he had leaked intelligence.<br />While the matter couldn't be made public due to the kingdom's relationship with the God of Ruin's followers, the king did reward Maddine's efforts with praise and a special promotion to head captain of the entire Holy Odal Kingdom's knights.<br />Maddine became a pillar of the kingdom's knights and would go on to achieve great things, but the Holy Armor Eidel she wore never spoke to her again, and its power slowly weakened.<br /><br />A few years after assuming the role of head captain, Maddine returned the Holy Armor Eidel to the storage room under the church where it once rested.<br />She understood by now. The Holy Armor Eidel had granted her wish and fulfilled its purpose. And for now, it should slumber and regain its strength in the hopes that it may one day offer itself to another young woman in need.<br /><br />"Thank you... for everything you've done for me."<br /><br />As the years passed, Maddine eventually retired from the knights. She knew the time had come when she met the young Princess Lilah, whose brilliance led Maddine to believe the princess could lead Odal towards a better tomorrow.<br />Once she retired, Maddine bought a ship. And just like the pirate she'd met as a girl, she spent the rest of her days sailing wherever the sea would take her.
