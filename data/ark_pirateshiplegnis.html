	<h4>The Pirate Ship's Secret</h4>
	<strong>Unlock at Lv2</strong>
	<br /><br />
	There once was a pirate ship known as the Legnis that freely sailed the Granzelia seas. It’s said that its helm was manned by a pirate who had earned his sea legs as a mere cabin boy in the Holy Odal Kingdom.<br /><br />At first, the ship’s travels were recorded by a young man who was aboard. After he parted ways with the crew, the remaining voyages lived on only in the memories of those who witnessed them firsthand.<br /><br />The ship’s captain sought out all the gold and treasure the world had to offer, and conquered the seas as the (self-proclaimed) King of Pirates.<br /><br />Incidentally, according to the records, the Legnis didn’t originally belong to him. One day, while the Legnis was docked, a black market fence asked the Pirate King who had crafted the ship and where he obtained it.<br />He responded by saying, “The Legnis wasn’t built by a country or an engineer. And I didn’t steal it, either.” The fence tried to ask for more details, but the Pirate King said no more.<br />The Legnis seems to harbor its own secrets…

	The aforementioned anecdote from the young man’s logs serves as the Pirate King’s testimony on the Legnis’ origins. Another entry in those logs says that the Pirate King received the Legnis from a voice he followed, but the details are tragically absent.<br />What manner of voice can give away an entire ship?<br />The Pirate King would likely have some idea, but he never spoke of it to anyone. And since the Legnis vanished along with its captain, there’s no longer any way for us to learn the truth… or so we thought.<br /><br />Recently, the prior story was found to have something in common with an ancient myth told in the Holy Odal Kingdom. Researchers began investigating to find the truth behind that mysterious voice.<br />And what was this myth?<br />It went as follows:<br /><br />Long ago, in ancient times, there lived a goddess who protected the seas while sailing upon them in a magnificent ship. This goddess served as a symbol of the sea’s bounty and tranquility.<br />She traveled the world, bringing good fortune to the waters she visited. It’s also said that her children could speak to the waves and would help their mother protect the seas.<br /><br />The ocean was peaceful until one day, the god of the land appeared before the goddess and her children. He had been gazing at the goddess while stuck on terra firma. Impressed by how well she and her children ruled the sea, he begged the goddess to teach him how to rule the land.<br />At first, the goddess turned him down, saying she had nothing to teach. But the god of the land said, “Just let me watch. If I get in your way, I’ll return ashore.”<br />The goddess agreed.<br /><br />True to his word, the god of the land stayed out of the way, treated the goddess with respect, and even played nice with the children. The goddess found herself opening up to him, and with the children already won over, the two grew closer and closer.

	But the peace between them suddenly shattered. One day, the goddess found that her children were missing.<br />The goddess searched high while the god searched low, but they were nowhere to be found.<br />Hoping they might at least return to her ship, the goddess entrusted her vessel to the god as she set off to continue her search.<br /><br />What she didn’t know was that it was all part of the land god’s plot. He hid the children to get the sea goddess to leave her ship behind. It was all to achieve his true goal: unchallenged rule over both land and sea.<br />While the goddess was away, he coaxed the children to come to his side while turning them against their mother, saying she had abandoned her own kin and left.<br /><br />When the goddess returned, she found the land god had taken command of her ship and was set on eliminating her.<br />The goddess tried to explain herself to her children and take back her vessel, but the land god’s brainwashing had been so thorough that they ignored her and instead used the waves to attack her.<br />The goddess may have been strong enough to reclaim the ship by force, but the thought of harming her children gave her too much pause to fight.<br />Had this also been part of the land god’s plan?<br />Unable to counter, the goddess came ever closer to defeat.<br /><br />Being betrayed by the man she trusted on top of her own children must have put the goddess through unimaginable despair.

	With the land god controlling both her ship and her children, the goddess was left completely drained. With every blow she took, the sea she had protected for so long grew torrid, harming all who lived in it.<br />Her love for her children may have made it hard to fight, but seeing her ocean in such a sorry state reminded her of her duty.<br /><br />With the last of her strength, the goddess struck back at the land god. The massive blow launched both him and the ship into the air.<br />But the land god, out of spite for the goddess, immediately took her children with him and disappeared into the sky.<br /><br />The goddess, now without a ship, had no way to rule the seas once more. She only had the energy to drag her ship’s wreckage to the bottom of the ocean and enter a deep slumber. There, she would recover her strength until the day where she could reclaim her tranquil waters.<br /><br />However, the passage of time can be cruel. As the years went by, the goddess’ once-honest passions warped into hatred toward those who had put her in this state.<br />And soon, that malice infested her ship. It had once been the symbol of peace, but now it was enveloped in darkness.<br />After enough time had passed for the goddess’ deeds to be nearly forgotten, a man was tossed to the seafloor where she slept. In a daze, she called the man over, eager to use him to aid her recovery.<br />But the man saw no goddess, only pure hatred given demonic form.<br /><br />Thus ends the myth once told in the Holy Odal Kingdom, with the main theory being that the Legnis was in fact a darkness-enveloped ship from the story.<br />But debates still rage over the myth’s authenticity, even within its country of origin. All we can be certain of is that the Pirate King lifted the Legnis from underwater and that he fought a demon to get it.
