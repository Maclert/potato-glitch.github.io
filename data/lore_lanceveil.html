	<h4>Leader of Imperial Army</h4>
	<strong>Unlock at Lv10</strong>
	<br /><br />
	A knight who served as the confidant to Roland, the Prince of Aldana Empire.<br /><br />Although being only the commander of the 3rd knight battalion, Lanceveil is in position to give command over the 2nd and 4th battlion as well, meaning that he has control over the empire's greatest anti-Beast army.<br />This position has given Lanceveil a great influence politically as well. As the youngest authority of the imperial military, Lanceveil is also a member the Imperial Council, often referred to as the Council of Ten.<br />As a childhood companion of Roland, the two learned swordsmanship together. Lanceveil holds absolute loyalty for Roland, to which the prince replies with deep trust. It is noteworthy that Prince Roland rarely give favorable treatments to Lanceveil, but will always trust him with the most critical of missions.<br /><br />Lanceveil is known as a laconic man, with little to no words being spoken at any given moment, but he is highly honored by his subordinates for always giving accurate orders.<br />Despite his distant personality, he is a caring leader who remembers the names of every soldier under him, even to the lowest of ranks. Amongst the soldiers, Lanceveil is said to be just about popular as Davan, the commander of the 12th knight battlion.<br />The greatest difference between the two was that Davan recognizes the individuality of his soldiers, and often give command accordingly. Lanceveil, on the other hand, believes discipline and unity was more important for the army.<br />As a result, Lanceveil would prefer a Jack of all trades as opposed to a master of none. But due to his policy of never abandoning anyone, especially the weaker lower ranks, Lanceveil is highly popular amongst soldiers who have average or lower capabilites.

	Lanceveil had been the servant of Prince Roland since childhood, but as a child of the lower nobility, originally, in any other instance, he would never had the chance to meet the prince.<br /><br />They first met when Lanceveil's older sister was chosen to be Roland's swordsmanship instructor, as she was rumored to be an unparalleled and undefeated genius.<br />The young lady didn't hesitate to dish out damage to the prince and her own younger brother. Eventually, the two boys bonded from the hellish training they went through together. Status no longer mattered to them when they were constantly looking up to the master swordswoman.<br /><br />Lanceveil described his childhood training as the following:<br /><br />"During training, my sister would beat us so badly.<br />It would've been humiliating if the purpose wasn't to learn from her. While I was fine with the harsh training conditions, when I was young I asked her if she would get into trouble for sending the prince back with bruises.<br />But she stubbornly replied that if she were to teach anyone, she wouldn't discriminate. Prince or pauper, they would receive equal treatment.<br />Prince Roland seemed to understand the concept as well. He never complained nor stopped coming to the training sessions. As the training session came to an end for the day, Prince Roland and I would often debate and banter back and forth on who came closer to winning against her.<br />Without a doubt, our skills and our stubborn personalities were because of her influence. However, looking back at it now, I realize that my sister must have been going easy on us."<br /><br />In terms of battle style, rather than the offensive attacks, Lanceveil preferred a defensive style. He would often catch the one moment of opportunity and deliver a single, powerful, deadly blow.<br />Some believe that he developed these skills in guarding after being accustomed to the powerful attacks of his sister.<br /><br />The instructor also gave her own comment on Lanceveil's battle style:<br />"Lance, my baby brother, has an incredibly tedious fighting style. <br />But... that's the exact reason why it would be remarkably difficult for anyone to defeat him. With the exception of me, of course."

	<h4>As a Knight</h4>
	<strong>Unlock at Lv50</strong>
	<br /><br />
	As he grew older, Lanceveil soon joined the Imperial Army as a knight. During that time, the Emperor's faction held great influence within the Empire. With rumors of discord between the emperor and the prince, Lanceveil was in a difficult position as a known ally of Roland.<br /><br />Despite being aware of the circumstances, Lanceveil still managed to focus on his duty as a knight. He soon made many achievements in battles with Beasts, as well as many bandits and criminals.<br />However, during his missions, Lanceveil noticed that the other knights were moving slowly and felt dull.<br />Lanceveil began losing both trust and respect for the other knights. He was outraged, as he figured that these knights were slacking off because they didn't want to help an ally of Roland.<br />Interestingly enough, Lanceveil soon realized that he was wrong. Lanceveil was so adapted and well-trained by his sister that he didn't grasp how much strength he had in comparison to the other knights. Understanding this fact, he decided to lead the battle as a vanguard, allowing others to easily fulfil the empty roles.<br /><br />After many missions, Lanceveil was one day suddenly visited by his older sister. It was completely out of the blue, and his sister didn't seem to have an urgent subject to discuss. She did, however, have something to tell him.<br /><br />"Lance, you get too focused on your surroundings. It's your strong point but it can also be your downfall. You need to take action freely, and do what you want, what you feel is right. Then you might see the world differently."<br /><br />Lanceveil did think it was an unusual thing for her to say, but he nodded to her sister, unaware of what was to come.<br /><br />The next morning, she had left the Empire.<br /><br />Lancveil was unable to comprehend his sister's true reason for leaving the Empire. However, in his heart, he undertood that she said those words because she was planning to never return.<br />Despite all of his emotions dragging him down, Lanceveil knew that his sister must have left the Empire with a great vision and strong will. After his sister had left, Lanceveil's determination to support Roland grew stronger. In his heart, he decided to swore absolute loyalty the Prince, and become his most trusted ally.

	<h4>Accomplished Knight</h4>
	<strong>Unlock at Lv80</strong>
	<br /><br />
	After gaining many achievements as a knight, Lanceveil was recognized and chosen to become the commander of the third knight battalion. The decision was partially made because Rounada, the former commander, was about to reach the age of retirement. Nevertheless, it was still a rare instance of such a young knight becoming a commander, and it was only possible because both Rounada and Davan, the commander of the twelfth knight battalion, had already acknowledged Lanceveil’s exceptional capabilities.<br /><br />After he became commander, Lanceveil decided to retrain the already well-performing third knight battalion. By taking a page from his sister’s regime, Lanceveil conducted extremely intensive training and overwhelmed many of his knights. However, he kept an eye out and gave each knight the right amount of scolding and encouragement they needed to succeed.<br />Due to his efforts, not a single knight in his battalion dropped out. It was said that the third knight battalion reformed into the most powerful troops in the empire.<br /><br />Lanceveil led the retrained third battalion on many reconnaissance missions in Central Lanzelia, a location where conflict often broke out between the empire and the Blaze. During these missions, the third battalion would take down many Beasts and capture many members of the Blaze, both of which were substantially weaker than the battalion.<br /><br />To reward his accomplishments in Lanzelia, Lanceveil was given command of the second and fourth knight battalions a mere year and a half after becoming the third battalion’s commander. Furthermore, he was chosen to become a member of the Imperial Council, which many referred to as the Council of Ten. Although many saw this promotion as the will of Prince Roland, no one could object because it was perfectly normal for a figure of authority in the Imperial Army to become a Council member.<br /><br />Interestingly enough, Eliza, director of the intelligence bureau, also became a member of the Council of Ten. She and Lanceveil shared many things in common, both having been alongside the prince since childhood. Despite their shared similarities, not only did the two hardly get along, there were even signs of them competing to demonstrate their loyalty to Roland. To many outsiders, they were as compatible as oil and water, excluding the times Roland ordered them to cooperate.<br />Despite this, witnesses also report the two Council members frequently going out to drink together, suggesting that the two might not be a couple, but certainly more than just friends.<br /><br />Lanceveil had this to say about Eliza:<br /><br />“Eliza? I see her as a younger sister figure of sorts. Although if you ask her, she would think of me as nothing more than an annoying brother getting in her way.”
