	<h4>Immortal Army</h4>
	<strong>Unlock at Lv2</strong>
	<br /><br />
	For a while after the Aldanian Empire was founded, the south of the Mordanian mainland was beset by a militia that indiscriminately attacked humans, filling them with fear and despair. It called itself the Immortal Army. The Immortal Army was commanded by a necromancer by the name of Liyen, and she filled their ranks with hordes of the undead.<br /><br />The name “Immortal Army” had not been given to the militia by Liyen but by opposing military forces. It came about as a description of their one particularity: when most undead are maimed in combat, they are neutralized – these undead could be smashed and turned to dust, yet Liyen’s call would still regenerate them. The dead she ruled over seemed just as immortal as their sobriquet suggested.<br /><br />Liyen’s Immortal Army at first targeted travelers and the people in local villages. But soon their sphere of destruction expanded, disrupting south Mordana’s trade and supply routes. In an attempt to resist, the neighboring cities banded together, they requested counter-threat squads be deployed from the Aldanian capital, and they even formed military companies filled entirely with mercenaries.<br />But not even such robust measures could keep the indestructible dead in check. Every soldier-for-hire was lost to the Immortal Army…

	The necromancer Liyen ruled over the Immortal Army as its only living member. From her youngest days, she had strange powers and an even stranger personality.<br /><br />As a girl, Liyen once returned home covered in blood. Her devastated parents rushed to attend to her wounds, but they didn’t find any. When they asked what had happened to LIyen, she responded:<br /><br />“I got lonely playing alone, so I decided to make some friends. Hehehe!”<br /><br />A procession of mutilated animal corpses then came into view from somewhere behind her. That ghastly sight was evidence that Liyen had the talents of a necromancer. When she reached adulthood, Liyen began serving as a mage in a band of mercenaries. They were at first lauded for keeping the beasts under control, and those around her at last breathed easy with the knowledge that she had grown beyond her errant ways.<br /><br />But she had joined the band of mercenaries because she could sense the scent of death heavy upon them – having killed many beasts in battle.<br /><br />Several months after Liyen joined the mercenaries, an incident occurred during a mission to vanquish a spellcaster who had laid claim to an ancient castle. Through intricate coordination, the members routed the spellcaster to the deepest quarters of the castle. He attempted to resist, but in the end he could not help but succumb to the seasoned warriors’ might. In his dying moment, the room glowed uncannily. Sensing magic like her own, Liyen immediately formed a magical barrier. With nowhere to run, the other members were absorbed by the light within moments. When it subsided, the members were shadows of themselves: the flames of life in their eyes had been snuffed out, their flesh was falling off the bone, and a carrion stench hung heavy upon them… their hideous forms were the very image of the undead.<br /><br />“Aaaah… What… happened… to you all?”<br /><br />Seeing the transformation of her comrades, Liyen fell weakly to her knees, but her face showed no trace of sadness.<br /><br />“Why do you look… so beautiful?”<br /><br />An expression of ecstasy swept over her visage.<br /><br />“Teeheehee… I finally know what I always wanted. I owe it all to you!”<br /><br />Not long after, Liyen slaughtered the other members who were waiting outside the ancient castle, and she used her powers of necromancy to turn them into undead. After this, she made more “friends”, and soon the Immortal Army earned a terrifying reputation.

	Following the defeat of the mercenaries hired by the cities of south Mordana, imperial counterthreat squads from the capital finally arrived. But with poor information gathering and underestimating the might of the opponents, General Simmons lost his life against the Immortal Army. The next in command, Vannon, managed to somehow maintain the forces and retreat in the face of destruction.<br /><br />(At this juncture, we cannot defeat the undead militia in battle. Should we return to the capital and report the situation, then muster in a larger force?)<br /><br />While he was debating the proper course of action, Vannon noticed a skull on the rump of his beloved steed. Alarmed, he immediately attempted to remove it, as it clearly belonged to a member of the undead forces. The moment he touched the skull, a voice resounded within his heart:<br /><br />"I am one of those you call the Immortal Army. Do not mistake me for your enemy, for as Liyen commands, so must I obey. Please free my soul – nay, all our souls."<br /><br />The voice had originated from the skull, which went on to explain that the militia's leader, Liyen, had sealed away the souls of the undead to prevent them from advancing to the afterlife. If Vannon were able to break that seal, the Immortal Army would immediately descend into nothingness.<br /><br />Hearing this testimony, Vannon set out after the enchanted urn of souls in the ancient castle – the castle where Liyen believed that she had found what she'd always wanted.
