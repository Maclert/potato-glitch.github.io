	<h4>Immortal Army</h4>
	<strong>Unlock at Lv2</strong>
	<br /><br />
	For a while after the Aldanian Empire was founded, the south of the Mordanian mainland was beset by a militia that indiscriminately attacked humans, filling them with fear and despair. It called itself the Immortal Army. The Immortal Army was commanded by a necromancer by the name of Liyen, and she filled their ranks with hordes of the undead.<br /><br />The name “Immortal Army” had not been given to the militia by Liyen but by opposing military forces. It came about as a description of their one particularity: when most undead are maimed in combat, they are neutralized – these undead could be smashed and turned to dust, yet Liyen’s call would still regenerate them. The dead she ruled over seemed just as immortal as their sobriquet suggested.<br /><br />Liyen’s Immortal Army at first targeted travelers and the people in local villages. But soon their sphere of destruction expanded, disrupting south Mordana’s trade and supply routes. In an attempt to resist, the neighboring cities banded together, they requested counter-threat squads be deployed from the Aldanian capital, and they even formed military companies filled entirely with mercenaries.<br />But not even such robust measures could keep the indestructible dead in check. Every soldier-for-hire was lost to the Immortal Army…

	The necromancer Liyen ruled over the Immortal Army as its only living member. From her youngest days, she had strange powers and an even stranger personality.<br /><br />As a girl, Liyen once returned home covered in blood. Her devastated parents rushed to attend to her wounds, but they didn’t find any. When they asked what had happened to LIyen, she responded:<br /><br />“I got lonely playing alone, so I decided to make some friends. Hehehe!”<br /><br />A procession of mutilated animal corpses then came into view from somewhere behind her. That ghastly sight was evidence that Liyen had the talents of a necromancer. When she reached adulthood, Liyen began serving as a mage in a band of mercenaries. They were at first lauded for keeping the beasts under control, and those around her at last breathed easy with the knowledge that she had grown beyond her errant ways.<br /><br />But she had joined the band of mercenaries because she could sense the scent of death heavy upon them – having killed many beasts in battle.<br /><br />Several months after Liyen joined the mercenaries, an incident occurred during a mission to vanquish a spellcaster who had laid claim to an ancient castle. Through intricate coordination, the members routed the spellcaster to the deepest quarters of the castle. He attempted to resist, but in the end he could not help but succumb to the seasoned warriors’ might. In his dying moment, the room glowed uncannily. Sensing magic like her own, Liyen immediately formed a magical barrier. With nowhere to run, the other members were absorbed by the light within moments. When it subsided, the members were shadows of themselves: the flames of life in their eyes had been snuffed out, their flesh was falling off the bone, and a carrion stench hung heavy upon them… their hideous forms were the very image of the undead.<br /><br />“Aaaah… What… happened… to you all?”<br /><br />Seeing the transformation of her comrades, Liyen fell weakly to her knees, but her face showed no trace of sadness.<br /><br />“Why do you look… so beautiful?”<br /><br />An expression of ecstasy swept over her visage.<br /><br />“Teeheehee… I finally know what I always wanted. I owe it all to you!”<br /><br />Not long after, Liyen slaughtered the other members who were waiting outside the ancient castle, and she used her powers of necromancy to turn them into undead. After this, she made more “friends”, and soon the Immortal Army earned a terrifying reputation.

	Following the defeat of the mercenaries hired by the cities of south Mordana, imperial counterthreat squads from the capital finally arrived. But with poor information gathering and underestimating the might of the opponents, General Simmons lost his life against the Immortal Army. The next in command, Vannon, managed to somehow maintain the forces and retreat in the face of destruction.<br /><br />(At this juncture, we cannot defeat the undead militia in battle. Should we return to the capital and report the situation, then muster in a larger force?)<br /><br />While he was debating the proper course of action, Vannon noticed a skull on the rump of his beloved steed. Alarmed, he immediately attempted to remove it, as it clearly belonged to a member of the undead forces. The moment he touched the skull, a voice resounded within his heart:<br /><br />"I am one of those you call the Immortal Army. Do not mistake me for your enemy, for as Liyen commands, so must I obey. Please free my soul – nay, all our souls."<br /><br />The voice had originated from the skull, which went on to explain that the militia's leader, Liyen, had sealed away the souls of the undead to prevent them from advancing to the afterlife. If Vannon were able to break that seal, the Immortal Army would immediately descend into nothingness.<br /><br />Hearing this testimony, Vannon set out after the enchanted urn of souls in the ancient castle – the castle where Liyen believed that she had found what she'd always wanted.

	After arriving at the ancient castle where Liyen dwelled, Vannon waited for nightfall and snuck in with his most skilled underlings. They were gripped by a nauseating stench as soon as they stepped into the castle. As their eyes adjusted to the dark, they realized that the odor was emanating from the corpses scattered throughout the castle. <br /> <br />"If we tarry long, we'll be driven to madness..." <br /> <br />Though nearly overwhelmed by the mountain of corpses, Vannon and company cautiously advanced. The castle's claimant did not attack, however, and the castle seemed wholly unguarded. The reason for this puzzling state of affairs would become clear when they reached the innermost quarters of the castle, which was assumed to contain the urn of undead souls. <br /> <br />The necromancer Liyen stood ready, surrounded by countless obedient undead. With no way out, Vannon and his party unmovingly scanned the room for the urn. It was visible to one side of the seat on which Liyen sat. Aware that no victory could be had against the dead in a war of attrition, the soldiers signaled to each other with a glance and forcefully charged through the enemy ranks toward the urn. <br /> <br />"If even one of us reaches the urn, we've won! If we stop, we've lost!" <br /> <br />Liyen was taken off guard by the daring offensive of Vannon and his men, who wildly mowed down the undead one after the next. Fear gripped her momentarily, but she hurriedly concentrated her magic and summoned new undead fighters to replace them. Neither she nor Vannon could have foreseen what would ensue: at once, the hatred and resentment of the undead saturated the air and warped the space above Liyen, signalling nothing less than an emergent dimensional rift. The unexpected development forced Vannon and company to stop where they stood. <br /> <br />"Agh, this won't work. For now we have to--" <br /> <br />Before he was able to utter the word "retreat", the situation rapidly advanced. From out of the rift pranced an inscrutable masked man at the speed of the wind. While Vannon and Liyen stood dumbfounded, he scattered a silver powder into the air, and as it fell on the undead they all turned to dust. As the space unwarped, Vannon and his allies saw their chance and rushed to smash the vessel of undead souls. A mistlike substance arose from the urn's shards and wrapped around Liyen. Anguish marked her face as she tried to shake it off, but before long she fell to the floor, drained of any power. <br /> <br />"Ah, I see... Now I will be as beautiful as them." <br /> <br />When Vannon examined Liyen, she had already breathed her last -- but on her face was an expression of joy. And though he wanted to thank the masked figure, it seemed to have fled as quickly as it came. In this way, the battle between Vannon and the necromancer Liyen concluded. The Immortal Army had vanished and would never be seen again. <br /> <br />After Vannon and his men returned to the capital and related their story, an imperial investigation unit searched Liyen's castle and promptly razed it to the ground. Some suggest that her necromantic scrawlings were taken back to the capital, but the truth cannot be ascertained at this time.
