	<h4>Beginning of the Story</h4>
	<strong>Unlock at Lv5</strong>
	<br /><br />
	A girl born in Samel Village. She lived there quietly on the continent of Odal that lies to the west of Aldana, until one day an airship belonging to Blaze appeared in the skies, and things were never the same.<br />Nothing much ever happened in her village, so when the huge airship touched down villagers went into a panic. When Theria saw it, however, she for some reason thought that her brother was finally back from his journey and dashed out to meet him.<br />Gasping for breath by the time she reached it, Theria was met not by her brother but by a lively red-headed girl around her own age.
	<br /><br />
	A crowd of soldiers stood behind the girl as if awaiting her command, and the other villagers cowered in fear. But Theria stood her ground without budging. Seeing this reaction the girl stepped down lightly from the airship, walked closer and proclaimed, "You must be Theria."<br />Thoroughly confused, all Theria could do was nod,<br />to which the girl said, "Alright then, let's go. The empire is after you, but Blaze will keep you safe." Without waiting for an answer she led Theria away.<br />The girl from Blaze later apologized to Theria and explained that her rashness was out of fear of being discovered by the empire. Theria must have sensed something about the girl that she trusted since she meekly obeyed her commands without question.
	<br /><br />
	Theria later learned that the girl's name was Lilebette. The Blaze soldiers were just as polite as she was, which helped Theria gradually get over her state of shock. She decided to ask Lilebette for details about what was going on, but just at that moment there was a loud crash. Alarms went off throughout the craft to alert everyone onboard that they were under attack by an airship from Aldana. Lilebette told Theria to hide and dashed outside.<br />Thrown into bewilderment once more, Theria's shock only grew more intense when the blue beast appeared, not to mention the red knight that accompanied him.<br />
	<h4>What is Ether</h4>
	<strong>Unlock at Lv30</strong>
	<br /><br />
	A force known as Ether was spoken of by Lily, one of the Council of Ten in the White Laboratory. It could be described as the “life force” possessed by all people, beasts and animals.<br />The term is not exactly common parlance, but anyone who has studied magic is sure to have heard of it. (Kyle certainly learned about it during his knight training classes.)
	<br /><br />
	Ether is often thought of as a form of energy and is indeed used as a source of power for some objects discovered in ruins from ancient civilisations.<br />Consuming one's Ether and putting it to use causes feelings of exhaustion, although they gradually wear off over time. Using massive amounts of Ether at once beyond what can be recovered puts the user's life at risk, however. For this reason the government banned the use of equipment that consumes Ether.
	<br /><br />
	Lily claims that Theria possesses massive amounts of Ether far beyond that of any normal person. She and Lanceveil knew that people like this existed in the world, but neither of them has any explanation for it. There also seems to be a secret as to why Theria is called “The Original,” but they haven't figured that out yet, either.
	<br /><br />
	There is a substance similar to Ether called 'Soul,' but it originates not only in people but also the land itself and other forms of nature.<br />
	<h4>Stolen Maiden</h4>
	<strong>Unlock at Lv50</strong>
	<br /><br />
	Theria was captured by Lanceveil and Eliza in the Imperial Capital of Aldana. When she came to she was in a room full of machinery she'd never seen the likes of before, restrained by a strange machine. Everything felt hazy. That's when Kyle and his companions arrived to rescue her, though she was barely conscious at the time.<br />Later she was transported from the Arcane Laboratory to the White Laboratory using Lily's gate, but she doesn't remember any of that.
	<br /><br />
	Her memory simply begins with waking up in an odd contraption in the White Laboratory. Despite everything she felt extremely relaxed at first.<br />This is likely due to her being raised in a remote village with little opportunity to ever see machines. The devices around her now were completely foreign and made the whole situation feel like something out of a dream, not real at all. She underwent many physical tests in these machines, but she experienced it in a detached state as if it were all happening to someone else—aside from the awful headaches, at least.
	<br /><br />
	Even if she had no idea where she was or what was happening to her, she did know one thing: Kyle and the others would rescue her. Of that she was certain. Her faith in them shows what a strong impression they'd left on her during their only brief interaction.<br />Theria held onto her resolve as Lily and other researchers watched inquisitively during the tests, waiting patiently for Kyle and the others to show up.
	<br /><br />
	At last they did, and their long-awaited arrival allowed her to relax and finally let out all her emotions. When Lily began explaining the secrets surrounding Theria, all the anxiety and fear she'd been holding back came rushing to the surface. The emotions quickly became too much to bear and her powers went wild once again, just as they had with Log Mechia and when Kyle was attacked by the man in black armor.
	<br /><br />
	Were these powers the key to saving the world, or a trigger to bring about its destruction? For the time being the answer was still unclear...<br />
	<h4>Samel Village Days</h4>
	<strong>Unlock at Lv80</strong>
	<br /><br />
	Theria's mind sometimes wanders back to when Kyle, Rei and Lilebette rescued her from the White Laboratory, and together they decided to head for Aldana. She also recalls her personal reasons for backing that decision...
	<br /><br />
	Five years ago, her brother never came back after leaving home to go on a journey. Left behind in Samel Village, she was worried and felt frustrated that there was nothing she could do.<br />Her parents had been gone for as long as she could remember, so her considerably older brother was like her mother and father in one person. The two siblings were very close and brought many warmth and joy to other villagers who witnessed their relationship.
	<br /><br />
	However, beginning when she was eight years old, her brother began going on frequent journeys outside the village. The neighbors looked after her during these periods, but after half a year of this, she began to live on her own instead. It wasn't that the neighbors disliked taking care of her; rather, according to a friend, she just wanted to show her brother how mature she'd grown in his absence.
	<br /><br />
	The same friend also mentioned that she was normally active and cheerful, but sometimes would retreat into her shell. It was more than just sadness about her brother being gone — almost as if she feared something inside her. Even at that young age, she was aware that a special power lay hidden deep inside.
