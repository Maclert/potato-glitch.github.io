	<h4>From Another Place</h4>
	<strong>Unlock at Lv2</strong>
	<br /><br />
	People and other strange items often cross from the other world and into Granzelia. They all have passed through a portal known as a dimensional rift at one point. Those from the other world have a great influence and have drastically changed the culture and technology within Granzelia. Drifting through the worlds has been confirmed long before the God of Ruin’s rule. However, most of those occurrences were tied in with severe storms, earthquakes, and other natural disasters of the sort. Because of this, researchers are still puzzled at how people and items crossed over from the other world.<br /><br />Some wondrous devices have been discovered, such as a relic that could record and play back audio and visuals. During the analysis of this strange device, it is said that if it were to be recreated, it would revolutionize current technology. This device alone had vastly changed the perception of the other world that had only been the stuff of dreams.<br /><br />Observations of Video Log No.001<hr />A blurry figure slowly becomes clearer. It appears to be a humanoid face.<br />“Testing, testing. Are you sure this is recording? Ah, well, I am Mephia 0044 of the Rabbit Platoon.”<br />The face is clear now, revealing the one named Mephia 0044 as a young woman. She has a crescent-shaped jewel on her forehead and black sclera instead of white. Other than that, her appearance was similar to a typical Granzelian woman, yet something about her would not classify her as human.<br />“I am in trouble. During a round-trip flight, I got stuck in this strange rift. I have sent out a rescue signal but I’m afraid it isn’t getting through. While I wait for assistance, I will investigate this strange space to see if I may learn more about it. I am afraid these messages will be the only things I leave behind. If anyone gets them, please send for help.”<br />She appears calm while under distress; while the ones watching this video file are surprised at the thoughts of beings from other universes having awareness of the inter-dimensional pockets in time and space. They speculate about there being a link between the world of Granzelia and another world. Perhaps this Mephia, who was stuck, resided in a dimension between doors to different universes.<br />There is movement and the recording device is turned to show what Mephia sees. The scenery of this other world.<br />“These gates are constantly opening and closing, unable to be maintained. Maybe one of them connects to my world, but it closes too quickly before I can tell. I wish I could go home and take a bath sometime soon…”<br />The footage cuts off for a moment, then reappears. The footage shows what is speculated to be a reddened “sky” and multiple black hole-like portals rapidly opening and closing at random. Occasionally pulling in whatever was close, other times spitting rubble out.<hr />This was the first recording on this curious device. Fortunately there are other files intact and will be researched on another day.

	<h4>Loneliness</h4>
	<strong>Unlock at Lv4</strong>
	<br /><br />
	Observations of Video Log No.009<hr />The image starts blurry, as always. It comes into focus and shows Mephia, who appears out of breath.<br />“I’m almost… at the top!”<br />She appears to be climbing a mountain of rubble. This is still within the strange space with the reddened sky.<br />“And we’re here! Let’s see if there’s anything else to see.”<br />The image shows the same sky and the debris that filled the wasteland, stretching for what looked like miles.<br />“I thought so… but still…”<br />Her voice wavers and her sniffles could be heard. The device is dropped, showing Mephia’s crouched shadow. She appears to have curled into herself and started crying.<br />“I want to go home… I’m so lonely here… Someone… Anyone, please… send help.”<br />Unlike all of her previous video logs, her usual peppy nature is not present. Fatigue and loneliness had caught up to her.<br />Everyone observing the footage had gotten attached to her and were now worried for her wellbeing. As this is only an aged recording, we knew there was little we could do to help.<br />After a few moments passed, Mephia had calmed her breath and wiped her tears. She gingerly picks up the recording device once more. She turns it to herself.<br />“I promise to get home. Just you wait.”<br />The footage ends here. We can speculate the next log will be her looking for ways to return to her home world on her own.<hr />This log had contained little new information, but served as a reminder to the researchers that they were not only interested in the other world, or possible worlds, but that they were interested in Mephia as well.

	<h4>A Creature</h4>
	<strong>Unlock at Lv7</strong>
	<br /><br />
	Observations of Video Log No.013<hr />The video log fades in to show Mephia reviewing the inside of a building that had accumulated various odds and ends. The size was perhaps the equivalent of the warehouses near the Holy Kingdom. The inside was a mess, everything tossed about and left to gather dust.<br />“It’s like a treasury! I wonder if there’s anything that could help me in here… something useful please…”<br />Mephia mumbles something else incoherently as she rummages through the items. She straightens her back and shows something to us. An aged and rusted emblem from the Holy Kingdom. This entire building may perhaps be from the Holy Kingdom or perhaps it was only the emblem. This one item she had randomly chosen had piqued our researcher’s interests even more.<br />“A history junkie like me would know, there isn’t a single place where this engraving is used back home. Whoever had this, maybe even collected all of this, might’ve been someone that fell into here the same way I did. Indigenous people from another world?”<br />After she turned the emblem to look at the engravings herself, the building shook. The device is knocked to the ground with the tremors. The sound akin to an explosion shortly followed.<br />“What was that?”<br />Mephia is crouched, holding the emblem over her head as if it would protect her from anything falling from above. The tremors cease, allowing her to retrieve the device. She appears to look up at something and her expression becomes tense. She slowly turns the device, the footage showing one large eye peering in through the entrance. A moment passes, both parties tense and unmoving. The pupil of the eye slowly grows smaller to a mere pinprick, and the creature that had the eye lets out an ear-splitting scream. The sound that was recorded was terrible, both in quality and the sound itself. Any personnel within vicinity covered their ears, and the ones closer to the device suffered an acute hearing impairment. If this is from a recording, who knows what degree of damage Mephia’s ears received.<br />The sound from the footage cut out soon after. There was vigorous movement and what was shown was a blur, but we assume that she is running from the giant creature and its eye as the footage ends abruptly.<hr />The footage shown here may prove the existence of that rift’s definition of a “beast”, yet these dreadful creatures are not nearly as small as any known beast in Granzelia. Based on the little information the footage provided, our researchers have started to calculate the possible size of it. If the calculations hold true, a single one of them could singlehandedly wreak havoc upon all of Granzelia.

	<h4>And Then</h4>
	<strong>Unlock at Lv10</strong>
	<br /><br />
	Observations of Video Log No.024<hr />The footage fades in to show that it is now on the deck of a skyship. There are a number of other skyships in the distance as well. Mephia steps out onto the empty deck.<br />“I can finally go home…”<br />“Mephia, are you sure you’re alright?”<br />The owner of the voice follows Mephia onto the deck. Another one of her race, in proper uniform.<br />“Captain! Yes, thank you. I’ve recharged my batteries and I’m ready to go!”<br />“That’s good to hear. And… why are you recording this?”<br />“I kept a video log of everything, so it’s only natural to document the end of it too! It was originally going to be like my dying will, but it ended up as an investigation of the rift dimension.”<br />“Hm, because you’re in one piece, I assume the investigation went well.”<br />“Oh right, about that. Along with the strange item I submitted for research, I ran into some creature.”
“A creature? Describe it to me.”<br />“It was huge. I only remember its huge eye and that noise–“<br />A piercing noise rang through the skies.<br />Both Mephia and the captain look up to the skies as the source of the familiar noise drew closer.<br />“Captain! That’s the thing! The creature!”<br />“This noise alone could kill anyone…”<br />The noise came closer and Mephia went to the device to point it to the creature. The same reddened sky of the rift but this time the colossal creature was clearly seen only for a split second. The footage ends here while the sounds are still recorded.<br />“Mephia, get out of the way!”<br />The scream from the creature only grew louder until all audio was suddenly cut off as well.<hr />Log number 024 is the final log that is on this peculiar device. How it survived the attack while Mephia and the captain did not is still a mystery.<br /><br />Her recordings not only provided information about the other world but also about the space between the two worlds. Despite the terrifying thing that was recorded, it still brought hope to the researchers by confirming several hypotheses and bridging disparate research groups. They now had concrete evidence instead of having to rely on tall tales of old. With a new foundation and a wealth of information, researchers flocked to replay the video and pick it apart, second by second.
