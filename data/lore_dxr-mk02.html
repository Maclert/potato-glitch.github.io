	<h4>The Machine</h4>
	<strong>Unlock at Lv10</strong>
	<br /><br />
	The existence of mechanical humanoids of unknown origin has been known to researchers for some time. Though multiple examples of the same general model have been confirmed, the best institutes for mechanical study found in both the Aldana Empire as well as Blaze have been unable to determine just how many such mechanical humanoids exist in the wild.<br />The vast majority of specimens which have been examined thus far seem to employ unknown technologies and materials which cannot be fully understood by modern practitioners.<br /><br />Though mechanical humanoids are capable of speech, most of the terms they use are of unknown meaning and in many cases, their speech seems directed not at others, but at themselves. For the above reasons, communication with them is virtually impossible.<br />Based on their appearance, it is clear that they were created primarily for combat, and when one encounters a human, it will almost certainly attack.<br /><br />However, in some very rare cases, a mechanical humanoid will request administrator authentication at startup. When this happens, anyone who registers their name will have the ability to command the machine.<br />Currently there are many unattended mechanical humanoids in Granzelia which are functional, but it is unclear by what mechanism they are able to move. Various research institutions remain busy trying to elucidate the underlying principles of their movement and behavior.

	<h4>True Rumors</h4>
	<strong>Unlock at Lv30</strong>
	<br /><br />
	The existence of mechanical humanoids of the type described above was not confirmed in Granzelia prior to the war between humans and the God of Ruin. It was only after the war started that they began to appear. Thus, many rumors and efforts at speculation have emerged over the years regarding the nature and origin of such mechanical humanoids.<br /><br />Examples of theories include speculation such as:<br />"Fierce battles occurring in various places opened a portal to another world, out of which the mechanical humanoids fell."<br />"They were summoned by servants of the God of Ruin from another world to destroy humanity."<br />"They were dug up by researchers seeking to defeat the God of Ruin, but their plan backfired and the mechanical humanoids now regard humans as antagonists."<br /><br />Though none of these theories have ever been confirmed, clues that may be useful to understanding the true identity of these machine humanoids are still being explored and investigated by researchers.

	<h4>Combat Ability</h4>
	<strong>Unlock at Lv50</strong>
	<br /><br />
	These humanoid machines, which almost universally regard humans as targets for attack, possess fearsome combat abilities. Many a warrior has lost their life attempting to subdue such creatures.<br /><br />The humanoid machines have the ability to fire low-power rounds from a triple-barreled gun mounted on the front of their bodies. These guns can also be used to launch smoke bomb rounds.<br /><br />In addition, these machines are reported to have the ability to draw surrounding combatants toward themselves. Although few have witnessed such an event, there is reliable testimony that suggests they are able to call down a scorching beam of light from the skies, laying waste to any enemies that happen to get caught in the beam, and scarring the surrounding earth.<br /><br />There are few who can stand up to such overwhelming firepower, and any soldier unfortunate enough to encounter a humanoid machine has but one option: to make a quick escape after waiting until the machine's fuel and ammunition runs out.

	<h4>As a Research Medium</h4>
	<strong>Unlock at Lv80</strong>
	<br /><br />
	Despite being shrouded in mystery, many examples of working mechanical humanoids can be found in Granzelia and there are many specimens which have since stopped working due to lack of fuel, or were broken during combat with adventurers or beasts.<br />These latter individuals are highly sought after in the Aldana Empire and Blaze. This is because the technology used in the mechanical humanoids is extremely valuable. For those engaged in the study of mechanical technology, decommissioned machine humanoids can serve as a treasure trove of information.<br /><br />Newly discovered specimens are transported to the appropriate institutions in both the Aldana Empire and Blaze, where they are studied and examined from head to foot.<br />Though there are rumors that the Imperial government is using the results of such research to control existing machine humanoids, or build new machines of a similar design, no proof of their success has yet surfaced.
