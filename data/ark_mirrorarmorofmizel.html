	<h4>The Lady Blacksmith</h4>
	<strong>Unlock at Lv2</strong>
	<br /><br />
	There was once a female master blacksmith who tended a store in Lanzelia’s castle town.<br />Her name was Mizel.<br />It was rare for women to be master blacksmiths at the time. She was constantly seen as inferior, and her shop received no praise.<br />It would be difficult to call her business popular, even if one were being polite. Mizel was able to operate solely thanks to some regular customers who recognized the quality of her equipment. She normally received almost no customers, but one day, a man approached her.<br /><br />“I want armor,” he requested as he opened the door. “Can you prepare some for me?”<br />With her hammer raised in the air mid-swing, Mizel could only stare at him in wonder. She couldn’t remember the last time a customer had walked in unannounced, so she hardly believed her ears when she heard his request.<br />However, she snapped back to her senses a few moments later.<br />“Uh, right. Armor, huh? Well, I am a master blacksmith. I’d be happy to fulfil a commission,” she said, setting down her hammer at last. “But you’re a bit of an oddball if your’e asking me. You’ve got tons of other options around here, you know?”<br />“Salido told me of your skill.”<br />“Huh…”<br />Salido was a merchant who frequently bought from Mizel’s shop. She had heard that even knights would buy his wares.<br />Could it be that this man himself was a knight?<br />On closer inspection, the man did have a toned, yet not overly muscular body. He was no doubt an experienced warrior.<br />“Don’t worry, I have money.”<br />“Huh…? Oh no, I wasn’t suspecting you of anything like that.”<br />“Oh… Sorry for saying something so strange, then.”<br />The man was quiet, yet quite apologetic. His face looked fierce, befitting of a warrior, but perhaps he was actually quite caring and compassionate on the inside.<br />Mizel felt odd as that thought crossed her mind.<br />“Teehee… So, what sort of armor would you like?”<br /><br />Thus was the meeting of Mizel and the warrior Amos.

	<h4>The Usual Routine</h4>

	“Wow, don’t you have any work to do?” Mizel teased, inspecting the sword Amos had handed her. “You don’t have to come to me for equipment maintenance. The knightly order or whatever it employs its own blacksmiths, doesn’t it?”<br />As Mizel chastised him, Amos looked at her apologetically. “Am I nuisance here?”<br />“Erm, no, you’re not.”<br />“In that case, I’m counting on you. The quality of your maintenance is on a different level compared to our smith.”<br />Being a warrior, Amos was no stranger to routine equipment maintenance. However, full-blown maintenance was a different story. Even the best of warriors needed help from master blacksmiths from time to time.<br />“Hmph… There’s no discount for flattery.”<br />“It isn’t flattery though.”<br />Through all her previous interactions with this man, Mizel could somehow tell that he did not give unwarranted compliments, and that he would never use flattery to get discounts. As she held Amos’ cherished sword to the grinder, Mizel continued, “Looks like it’s in pretty bad shape. Where’d you take it this time?”<br />“The mountain range by the Ice Dragon Cavern.”<br />“You went all the way out there? You guys sure have it rough.”<br />“Nearby residents asked that we defeat some Beasts that were causing them trouble. The journey was indeed difficult, but… Well, it was the natural thing to do as a Knight of Blue Lights.”<br />Mizel had known a number of other Knights of Blue Lights besides Amos. They were all diligent, righteous people, but she felt Amos was by far the most honest.<br />“Well, if you’re saying my work as a master blacksmith has been helping you help others, I guess I’ve got no complaints.”<br />“The work I’ve commissioned from you has been a great help, Mizel. I guarantee it.”<br />“I already told you, there’s no discount for flattery.”<br />Once she finished grinding his sword, Mizel smiled to herself and began maintenance work on Amos’ armor.

	“Sorry for making you stick with me.”<br />Mizel drank down her glass. Amos sat at the other side of the table.<br />As always, Amos had come to Mizel to have her maintain his equipment, but there had been a sudden change in the weather. By the time the maintenance was complete, the snowstorm outside was so intense that it was impossible to even walk outside.<br />Since Amos could not leave, Mizel offered to have him for drinks until the storm was over.<br />“I didn’t expect you to offer me alcohol.”<br />“Well, you know, it’s just one of those days. Besides, I don’t have any real work right now besides your stuff.”<br />“Are you cutting down on commissions?”<br />“Nope, there really are none.”<br />“There aren’t? With your skill, I was sure you’d–“<br />“Hmph! There just aren’t many people brave enough to commission work from a woman with burn marks on her face.”<br />Mizel gulped down another glass of alcohol.<br />“You see, I got these burns… when I was young and reckless. Well, I don’t regret a thing since that’s what got me here today.”<br />Mizel refilled her empty glass.<br />“But thanks to these, everyone’s too afraid to approach me. In the end, master blacksmiths are just another type of service worker. My appearance hasn’t exactly done me any favors.”<br />Amos looked closely at Mizel as he carefully chose his next words. “That’s because… they don’t know the real you. Your work is magnificent.”<br />He then steeled himself for his confession.<br />“And you… are quite charming, yourself.”<br />“What are you saying, Amos?”<br />“…”<br />Unable to handle the sudden change in mood, Mizel forced a smile to smooth things over. “Hmph. Cut it out already. Let’s not talk about that sorta stuff anymore. I feel like I’ve sobered up.”<br />“I see.” Mizel glanced out the window. “Besides, it looks like the snowstorm’s over.”<br />While the sky was still overcast, the pounding snow had indeed ceased.<br />“You never know when the weather’s gonna change. So if you wanna go home, now’s your chance.”<br />“Mizel, I…”<br />“Sorry. I know I invited you to stay, but please go home.”<br />“Okay.”<br />Amos knew there was something he had to say to her. But unfortunately, he was unsure of precisely what it was.

	“You’re here to pick up your armor, ain’tcha? It’s done. Made it especially to resist magic since you said it was a weakness of yours.”<br />Mizel said everything in one breath as soon as Amos opened the door to her store.<br />When he saw the armor before him, Amos could only praise her work, awestruck.<br />“I expected nothing less from you.”<br />“You sure you can judge it before you’ve even tried it on?”<br />“You made this armor. I can tell its quality without even wearing it.”<br />“Hmph.”<br />It wasn’t rare for Amos to heap praise upon Mizel’s work. Mizel was never unhappy to be praised, per se, but this time, there were circumstances that prevented her from taking the compliment with a straight face: Amos had ordered this armor for a reason.<br />“Will this next battle… really be that tough?”<br />“Yeah. Honestly, I don’t know if I’ll come back alive.”<br />“…”<br />Mizel could feel the gravity of the situation from Amos’ words. She was not too informed about war in Lanzelia, but she could feel in her bones that the entire nation was on edge.<br />With a tense expression, Amos began to speak the words he knew he must.<br />“There’s something I need to say. And this might be my last opportunity to do. Mizel, I–“<br />“Please, stop!” she cried before he could finish. “I don’t know what you’re trying to say, but right now, I’m just a master blacksmith offering my best armor to the best warrior. Nothing more, nothing less.”<br />“Mizel…”<br />“But if you need me as something other than a master blacksmith… then come back alive and see me then.”<br />Mizel had already known for some time what it was Amos wanted to say to her. But at that moment, she couldn’t let him say it. She couldn’t let herself hear it.<br />Something just gave her that feeling.<br />Perhaps Amos could tell how she felt too. His pensive expression finally relaxed.<br />“Okay. Then I’ll be back. I swear it.”<br />With Mizel’s armor in hand, Amos started to leave.<br />As she watched him go, Mizel couldn’t help but call his name.<br />“Amos!”<br />“Something wrong?”<br />“…”<br />She had trouble finding the words.<br />After some thought, she gave a reply that was nothing special, just typical Mizel.<br />“If you come back, bring your equipment over to me as soon as possible. I’ll make it as good as new.”<br />“Yeah, I know,” Amos responded with a smile.<br />He then left the store – this time, for good.<br /><br />The armor Mizel gave to Amos at this time would later go down in history as the Mirror Armor Mizel. Originally, it had no such name, but it was later named after its creator.<br />It is said that studies of the armor led to several advancements in the craft of armor creation.<br /><br />Incidentally, the battle Amos faced was fierce, unlike anything the knight had seen before. While the battle resulted in a narrow victory for the Kingdom of Lanzelia, it did not come without great cost.<br />Amos was among the missing, his death or survival unknown.<br />Immediately following the battle, Mizel closed up shop and left for places unknown.
