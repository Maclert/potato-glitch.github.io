	<h4>The Arena’s Grand Opening</h4>
	<strong>Unlock at Lv2</strong>
	<br /><br />
	[We’ve got a big project in the works with Monthly Atalba! Check out the serialization “The Aldana Arena”!]<br /><br />The place where swordsmen test their mettle against one another… the Imperial Aldana Arena. There’s a rush of spectators again today, addicted to watching how the heated battles unfold.<br />But do you know the history behind the arena?<br />It goes way back, having opened long before the battle between the God of Ruin and the hero Adel. It dates back all the way to the time when all of Aldana was ruled by the Holy Kingdom.<br />Back then, the rule of the Director-General was in title only. The supervisors deployed by the Holy Kingdom had seized substantial power, exploiting and causing long suffering for the citizens of Aldana. One of the supervisors, Logen, came up with the idea of distracting the citizens from their discontent by opening an arena where enslaved gladiators would fight one another. Some theorize though that he opened the arena for himself rather than the people.<br />In any case, he ordered the Director-General to construct the arena and assemble gladiators.<br />That is how the history of the arena begins.<br /><br />The next chapters of the series will include the following:<br /><br />Chapter 2, “The Carnage They Wished For: Phase One”<br />Chapter 3: “Thirsting for Battle: Warriors Assemble”<br />Chapter 4: “Road to Rebuilding: The Arena Today”<br /><br />Please look forward to it!

	<h4>The Carnage They Wished For: Phase One</h4>

	By order of Logen, a supervisor of the Holy Kingdom, the arena was finally completed in the town of Aldana (present-day Imperial Capital Aldana). However, the battles fought by slaves weren’t like the fake battles that are fought there today – they were battles in the real sense of the word…<br />They fought one another to the death.<br />Some scorned the bloody performances, but the great majority of the masses loved it.<br />For those who could not air their daily discontent with the Holy Kingdom, watching these battles of life and death was an ideal way to let off steam. You could say that Logen’s plan was a huge success.<br /><br />Most of the gladiators were criminals, prison inmates, but ironically, the majority were Aldanians. The battles between the enslaved gladiators continued beyond Logen’s term, even after he left Aldana, and they only grew more extreme.<br />It soon became an everyday occurrence for the combatants to face off against ferocious Beasts. There are records of Beasts even being imported, ones they assumed the gladiators would never be able to defeat so the people could enjoy watching the slaughter.<br /><br />One theory even goes as far to suggest that even the God of Ruin’s followers had been invited to the Holy Kingdom to enjoy the savage spectacle that is the arena.

	<h4>Thirsting for Battle: Warriors Assemble</h4>

	The cruel battles in the arena continued for a long time, but their popularity eventually began to wane. People were gradually tiring of the butchery. And that’s when real warriors showed up, including Ignis, who would later go down as a heroine of legend.<br />They were not slaves like the combatants in the arena had been thus far; these warriors had heard about the arena and gathered from all corners of the country to fight of their own free will.<br />They also put their lives on the line by fighting with real weapons, but unlike past battles, there was no pointless bloodshed – they had come to the arena purely to test their own skill with the blade.<br /><br />It’s not hard to imagine that after having seen only brutal battles before, these clean and highly skilled fights were like a breath of fresh air for spectators. People went wild over these battles between real warriors fighting with all their might to prove their strength. The arena became popular yet again.<br />The spectators had mainly comprised of men before, but women and children must have started coming to watch as well.<br /><br />The combatants of the arena became more than a means of settling the feelings of strife felt by the citizens; they had at one time even been adored. Incidentally, the representative warrior from this age was Ignis. She was proud of her unrivaled strength, and it is said that she even had many adoring fans among women.

	Spectators were enthusiastic about the arena matches between real warriors. However, it was not long before its doors had to be closed for a period of time.<br />Humanity had begun to take up arms against the God of Ruin, starting with the hero Adel. The entire world of Granzelia was embroiled in war. The warriors of the arena also threw themselves into the war, playing an active role in it.<br /><br />After the battle against the God of Ruin came to an end, Aldana went to war against the Holy Kingdom to reclaim their independence. It wasn’t until much later, after the Aldana Empire was founded, that the arena was finally reopened. The occasion for its reopening came when there was a rumor going around that the government was planning to tear the long-neglected arena down during reconstruction of the capital.<br />The people who heard thus rumor vehemently opposed the decision and started protesting. It was only a rumor, but there was a considerable number of the upper echelon of the empire who loathed it as a symbol of the Holy Kingdom’s former rule, since they were the ones who had built it. Thus, the rumor had potential validity. (Later it was confirmed to have been a suggestion by a certain official when they were laying out the plans for urban development.)<br /><br />The emperor was surprised by the public’s response. He quickly made the decision to have the arena fixed up and operated as a public institution. One year of preparations later, the arena was revived with a new form.<br />There was once again battles between warriors staking their honor and competing for monetary prizes.<br /><br />However, a problem occurred shortly after its reopening.<br />This problem came in the form of combatants summoning spirits of the deceased to come and fight for them. Many knights in the empire have been able to use this ability, and it was one of the driving forces that led to Aldana’s independence. Therefore, it was only a matter of course that warriors who utilized summoning would step into the arena as well. And with a single person summoning multiple spirits to fight at their side, one could say that the fighting style in the arena was on an entirely different level.<br />Those who had been longtime fans of the arena displayed reservation at these types of fights that borrowed the strength of spirits, but there were many who insisted that it was just a brand-new style of fighting.<br /><br />Ultimately they were unable to conclude which side was right and decided to divide the fighting into two types of battles: traditional battles where the warriors would fight with their own mettle, and battles where summoning was allowed.<br />However, battles with summons started to gain in popularity since it was exciting to see multiple spirits fighting at once, so these types of fights gradually became mainstream. Meanwhile, the more traditional battles began losing popularity and were eventually discontinued.<br />And that brings us to the way things are done in the present-day Aldana Arena.<br /><br />This concludes the simple retelling of the history of the Aldana Arena. A ceaseless succession of warriors…<br />Who will next step into the arena, and what kind of star might they become?<br />Let’s watch the battles unfold to find out.<br />You are a witness to history in the making.
