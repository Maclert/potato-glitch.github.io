	Following the war against the God of Ruin, there existed a mysterious wandering swordsman named Shin who traveled Granzelia seeking power. With his seemingly otherworldly strength, he defeated the Divine Beast Radigus and became known throughout the land as the “Godslayer”.<br />And that was only the beginning of his heroic legend.<br /><br />One day, he received a request from a small countryside village to defeat a giant dragon. The village was known for the vast acres of farmland tended to by most of its residents, but a lone dragon made a nest nearby and attacked livestock and landowner alike.<br />Shin arrived at the village and learned it had a watchtower, which he climbed to lie in wait for the dragon. He stood where the dragon would have the clearest view of him, betting that the Beast would attack.<br />And once the sun reached its peak, the dragon obliged.<br />It typically began its attacks by targeting animals, but this time it dove straight for Shin; perhaps it could sense his hostility.<br />Though it tried to intimidate the swordsman, he did not flinch, and only had this to say:<br /><br />“I suppose that’s all I can expect from a mere dragon…”<br /><br />The next moment, he unleashed a strike so quick it seemed as though he’d leapt into the sky, and felled the dragon with that single blow.<br />The villagers cheered for Shin, celebrating their newfound liberation, but rather than sharing in their joy, Shin instead let out a sigh of dissatisfaction.<br /><br />There are many legends spoken of this man… though the number pales in comparison to the amount of heroic deeds he performed in the other world before arriving in Granzelia.

	The first of Shin’s acts that shook his world was taking on 48 assailants at once. He had wandered in search of strong opponents even in his youth, and was one day invited to stay at the mansion of a wealthy landowner.<br />This landowner delighted in hearing the tales of martial artists and gave Shin the reception of a king. Shin paid back his generosity not just with stories, but also by crafting toys for the manor’s children.<br />But it was when night fell that this tale took a turn.<br /><br />While the entire estate slumbered, Shin sensed a presence that bolted him awake. He scanned his surroundings, and found that the mansion was surrounded by armed men.<br />Deducing that they were after the mansion’s fortune, Shin sprung into action, hiding the family in the cellar before racing outside to head off the thieves.<br /><br />“You’ll have to go through me first!”<br /><br />The thieves hesitated for a moment when faced with this interloper, but they soon drew their weapons and went for Shin’s throat. Unfortunately, a mere bandit could never hold a candle to Shin’s swordsmanship. Every thief whose moonlit shadow crossed Shin’s was one more thief cut down where they stood.<br /><br />When dawn broke, the landowner left the cellar to find his estate littered with the bodies of the defeated intruders.<br />48 of them, to be exact.<br />The landowner, overflowing with gratitude, offered Shin a permanent residence on the estate and even his daughter’s hand in marriage.<br />Shin never ran from a battle, but in the face of such an unexpected proposition, he had no choice but to mutter that his training was more important and make his escape.<br /><br />The landowner continued to invite martial artists to his home, but only to tell them the tale of when a wandering swordsman saved him from four dozen attackers…

	<h4>Demon Killer</h4>
	<strong>Unlock at Lv7</strong>
	<br /><br />
	During Shin’s time in the other world, he fought not only masters of the martial arts, but also non-human monsters.<br />His first time facing one was when he was hired to do so by a liege lord. By this time, Shin had gained a bit of notoriety from the battle against his 48 assailants. Hearing of this man’s prowess, the liege lord ordered his servants to seek Shin out and summon him to the castle.<br /><br />Once Shin had arrived, the lord spoke of a fearsome demon who appeared to slaughter livestock and serfs alike. The lord sent servants to defeat this demon, of course, but all were defeated as their blades failed to pierce the thick hide enveloping its trunk-sized limbs.<br />Being tasked with defeating this demon lined up well with Shin’s search for worthy opponents, so he accepted without a second thought. He quickly made his way to where the demon was last seen.<br /><br />When Shin finally came face to face with the demon, he was taken aback by its sheer size. But as a battle-hardened warrior, he quickly regained his composure, and began his attack.<br />The demon’s swings were powerful, certainly, but they were sluggish, and hardly difficult for Shin to evade. The difficulty came in piercing the demon’s rugged skin, as many of Shin’s blows scarcely made a scratch.<br /><br />“Quite the challenge… So this is the strength monsters are capable of.”<br /><br />Having understood his opponent, Shin repeatedly targeted the same spot on the demon’s right arm, slowly chipping away at its skin. When the demon finally noticed something was amiss, the skin on its arm had been completely shaved off – at which point Shin severed the limb with one clean slice.<br />With steady swordsmanship, Shin repeated this tactic on the demon’s left leg, then severed its left arm.<br />And finally, he went for the jugular.<br /><br />It’s said that this battle taught Shin that battling monsters can reveal ever more secrets of the blade.<br />This is when Shin earned the nickname “Shin the Demon Slayer”, a title that would travel far and wide.

	<h4>Otherworldly Wanderer</h4>
	<strong>Unlock at Lv10</strong>
	<br /><br />
	As the reputation of “Shin the Demon Slayer” spread, Shin was one day approached by a man out of the blue. According to this man, the sky above his kingdom’s castle had suddenly rent into two, and from the gap appeared a monster none had seen before.<br />This fearsome Beast had the torso of a tengu (an ill-natured demon with avian features) atop the body of a serpent. The man and his lord had taken up arms in retaliation but failed to put up a fight. And so, this man sought for Shin to avenge his fallen lord and comrades.<br /><br />Shin felt pity for the man’s misfortunes, but couldn’t hide his exhilaration at the promise of a worthy opponent.<br /><br />Once Shin finally reached this kingdom, he found a ruined, ravaged castle inhabited by the creature he set out to exterminate. Shortly after their battle began, Shin felt something bizarre.<br />This monster displayed techniques and tactics that differed from any opponent Shin had ever fought.<br /><br />“What devilish attacks!”<br /><br />This abnormal opponent proved to be a tougher match than Shin had expected.<br />However, he had already taken the heads of many demons and Beasts by this point, so he had experience in battling the unknown. He slowly caught onto its patterns, and while he couldn’t quite land a killing blow, he made sure each slash struck its mark. Once the monster felt it had spilled enough blood, it fled into the castle.<br />It may have been weakened, but a fool could tell that it would pose a threat to others if it escaped with its life.<br />And Shin was no fool.<br /><br />He followed its tracks and cornered it in a nearby village.<br /><br />“I’m afraid I can’t allow you to leave. No hard feelings.”<br /><br />Shin lunged to make one final blow. But at that very moment, the monster’s body swelled and let loose a massive explosion.<br />It drew out the last of its strength to self-destruct, aiming to take Shin down with it.<br />But Shin, sensing a trap, narrowly dodged the blast and survived by the skin of his teeth. The blast sent shockwaves throughout the area, somehow opening a tear in the sky.<br />This gap began sucking in Shin and the entire village nearby. And when Shin awoke, he saw before him the vast land of Granzelia.<br /><br />Tales of Shin’s life from the other world have long been shared among researchers, but nobody knows where they originated from.<br />Some have also theorized that the monster that brought Shin to Granzelia originally came to Shin’s worlds from ours.
