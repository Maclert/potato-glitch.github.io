	<h4>The Mysterious Treasure</h4>
	<strong>Unlock at Lv2</strong>
	<br /><br />
	There once was a thief who targeted treasures in historic ruins. He was a chivalrous sort of thief, preferring to steal from rich families whose names had been marred by scandals. After the heist, he would then redistribute the loot to the needy.<br /><br />Bur according to records written by one country’s prince, the thief had another face: a treasure hunter who made his way through various ruins after tossing away what remained of the stolen wealth. His showy methods of reaching the treasures within were just as adept as those he used to steal from the rich.<br /><br />His exploits in the ruins followed a characteristic pattern: he would reach the treasure, leave a mark, and exit without stealing it.<br />The thief committed several of these bizarre non-robberies.<br />It is still unknown why he was so fixated on the ruins’ treasures; however, as he was an ally to the weak and ever popular with the people, his story is still told today.<br /><br />Perhaps the most well-known story regarding this man and the ruins’ treasures is the story of the Hidden Treasure, Makyuodyne. Though famous, few details have surfaced about this treasure other than that it is supposedly deep in some unidentified ruins. Neither its contents nor its value are known to this day.<br />Perhaps the following story can lend some insight into why the details surrounding this treasure are so obscured.

	<h4>Perilous Path to Treasure</h4>
	<strong>Unlock at Lv4</strong>
	<br /><br />
	The thief was on one of his usual robberies. But among the riches he stole from a noble, he found a clue to the location of the Hidden Treasure, Makyuodyne. He followed the trail to some ancient ruins and thereafter began his search.<br />According to the clue, the treasure was stashed away deep within the ruins, and so he made his way further and further inside.<br /><br />However, the ruins were filled with traps to protect its treasure, and thus the journey to it was said to be quite perilous.<br />For example, there was a room where stepping on the wrong stone would launch poison darts. In another room, the walls would push closer and closer together, making the room dangerously narrow, until a secret switch was pressed.<br />Allegedly, there was even a room where the thief had to select the correct box containing a key or otherwise be faced with venomous snakes.<br /><br />He overcame each obstacle, but was then held back in an unexpected way – by a dual-wielding swordswoman. The swordswoman had already heard that the famous thief was after this treasure, so she had been waiting there to ambush him.<br />She had obstructed all of the thief’s previous attempts at treasure hunting in the other ruins, and blocked his way time and time again.<br /><br />However, they had never truly fought over treasure before. Since the thief would always leave the ruins without looting, she had no reason to fight him.<br />The precise cause of their antagonism is unknown, but simply put, the thief was someone who wanted to reach the treasure, and the swordswoman was someone who wanted to protect the treasure and preserve its condition.<br />In any case, it is said that the two crossed blades even in these ruins.

	<h4>An Unexpected Twist</h4>
	<strong>Unlock at Lv7</strong>
	<br /><br />
	The thief and the swordswoman had an intense, drawn-out battle. Blade clashed against blade as the sharp ringing of steel echoed off the ruin walls.<br />This thief had snuck into the homes of nobles, no matter what sort of security they had, and easily taken down any guard he came across. Yet the swordswoman was on equal footing with him.<br />It is said that her power came not only from her skilled swordsmanship, but also from her own unique magic power.<br /><br />As the two fought over the treasure, neither willing to back down, the battle ended in a completely unprecedented way.<br /><br />While they fought, another bandit invaded the ruins in an attempt to steal the treasure. With a newfound common enemy, the two called a truce and cooperated to drive away the bandit – their common goal being that of preventing the new bandit from stealing the treasure.<br />However, even if that theory is correct, it’s in direct conflict with the swordswoman’s goal of preserving the condition of the treasure; however, the confrontation may have been unavoidable.<br /><br />As the two of them had come into conflict many times over, they knew one another’s strong points and thus had magnificent coordination in their confrontation with the bandit. However, the bandit was under the employment of a country and backed by a considerable amount of soldiers, who enveloped the two with their sheer numbers.<br />Thereafter, the bandit successfully captured both of them. His employer, a prime minister, then appeared in the ruins.<br />The prime minister was plotting to use the treasure in these ruins to fill his own pockets and take control of both his country and the world. However, he still did not know where the treasure was, and thus tried to force the thief and swordswoman to guide him to it.

	<h4>The Plot Thickens</h4>
	<strong>Unlock at Lv10</strong>
	<br /><br />
	The prime minister had employed a bandit while coveting the Hidden Treasure, Makyuodyne for himself. The swordswoman was vehemently opposed to helping him out, but the thief began to talk about how he had deciphered a clue as to the treasure’s location. The prime minister was aware of the thief’s knowledge and skills and suspected that the thief was trying to fool him, so as a precaution, he made his two captives lead the way to the treasure.<br /><br />The legendary treasure sat there in a chest, exactly where the thief had said it would be, and thus its existence was confirmed. The prime minister gleefully tried to open it.<br />At that moment, the thief unfastened his fetters, grabbed the swordswoman, and rushed for cover.<br /><br />When the prime minister opened the treasure chest, out spilled several soul-eating vengeful spirits. The spirits annihilated both the prime minister and the bandit, sparing only the thief and the swordswoman who were hidden under cover.<br />As if he had known the true nature of the treasure from the start, the thief waited for the situation to settle before closing the chest once more, and locking it tight.<br />It’s unknown what happened between the two survivors after that, but it is thought that they parted without fighting again.<br /><br />Perhaps the thief worked to ensure this disastrous treasure could never be used again. So was the Hidden Treasure, Makyuodyne a treasure at all, or was it simply a wolf in a treasure’s clothing?<br />Who would place such a dangerous object deep within ancient ruins, and for what purpose?<br />Now that the thief has sealed it away, no one will know.<br />All we do know is that the story of this treasure is not simply a fairy tale.
