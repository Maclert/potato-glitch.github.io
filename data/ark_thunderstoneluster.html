	<h4>The Secret Stone</h4>
	<strong>Unlock at Lv2</strong>
	<br /><br />
	In the age when the God of Ruin ruled over all, the Kingdom of Mordana appeared — at least, on the surface — to be wholly compliant.<br />But within the country was a melange of feelings: some citizens struggled to wrest themselves from under the God of Ruin’s thumb, while others trembled in fear of the god’s wrath, praying only that they could continue to live their lives in peace.<br /><br />Among these dissenting opinions were members of the royal family, who felt they should increase their strength in order to one day rise up to fight against the God of Ruin.<br />This group was secretly planning to gain the power of the legendary Thunderstone Luster, which had been rumored of in the kingdom since ancient times. It was said that the Thunderstone Luster held within it the magical power of thunder and lightning. With proper training, that power could be imbued into a sword, giving the user the power to oppose even the gods themselves.<br /><br />The knights of the kingdom searched frantically for the gem, but could not find it anywhere. The royals debated on why the gem was so elusive, and soon the theory that the stone would only reveal itself to a worthy person of proud and noble blood gained prominence.<br />And so the right to search for the gem was given to a certain aristocrat with an ancient and honorable bloodline.<br />This noble had earned fame for being incredibly brave and fiercely loyal to the kingdom. Eventually, he took on a knight of a lower order as his bodyguard.

	<h4>The Hunt for the Stone</h4>
	<strong>Unlock at Lv4</strong>
	<br /><br />
	Considering the influence their Thunderstone Luster research might have, the noble and lower-ranking knight decided to carry it out in complete secrecy.<br />However, the legend of a gem powerful enough to oppose the gods had slowly begun spreading outside of the kingdom. Thus, the two of them often went to battle with those seeking the jewel.<br />Everyone they fought seemed to desire it for their own benefit, either to sell for profit or to present to the God of Ruin in the hopes of self-promotion. Meanwhile, the noble and the knight formed a bond beyond that of master and servant – a bond of friendship.<br /><br />The two of them overcame countless hardships and finally located the whereabouts of the Thunderstone Luster. But there too they encountered those who sought it for themselves.<br />They were ambushed by enemies trying to steal the gem for their own selfish purposes. At that moment, the gem suddenly discharged bolts of lightning, instantly killing all of the thieves.<br /><br />Afterward, the two stood before the gem, and the knight touched it to make sure it was safe. The jewel emitted a faint light, but no lightning.<br />Now the knight was convinced of one thing: the Thunderstone Luster had chosen a noble, who had a pure soul.<br />As the two of them set off on their journey back to the kingdom, they were attacked by Beasts and thieves, but it is said that the gem’s light protected them each time.<br /><br />They returned safely, and after fitting the gem to a sword, they began to train with it.

	<strong>Unlock at Lv7</strong>

	They conducted their training at Mordana Castle. Luckily, the gem discharged no lightning between the two of them, so they were able to train safely. During this time, the royalty began discussing whom the sword would be entrusted to.<br /><br />Some advocated that the sword should be held by the king or the prince as a symbol of their country. However, many were wary of the lightning the noble and knight had reported seeing, and they feared tragedy could strike the moment any royalty were to take hold of the weapon.<br />Thus, the royals decided to give the sword to the very noble who had brought back the gem.<br />They were still unclear as to what caused it to emit lightning and how to avoid it, and so they felt this was the most favorable option.<br /><br />The noble accepted the sword under the condition that the knight be granted the position of his attendant. The knight’s accolades in battle, including the search for the Thunderstone Luster itself, had earned him a great deal of trust, and thus the royalty easily agreed.<br />In their quest for the jewel, the knight had become deeply loyal to the noble, and now swore to continue serving him in an official capacity.<br /><br />Later, as though fate had waited for the sword’s completion, the God of Ruin’s followers invaded the kingdom. The royalty ordered the noble and his knight to wield the power of the Thunderstone Luster and annihilate the invaders.<br /><br />The two of them fought against the invasion again and again, but they were unable to eradicate the god’s forces. It would seem they had waged war without knowing for certain whether the sword would exhibit the Thunderstone Luster’s power.<br />While it did indeed glow, the weapon did not seem to have any particular effect against their enemies. Consequently, the knight’s and noble’s only formidable power was their bond.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the noble was slain under the blade of one of the invaders. As the knight lamented his inability to protect his charge, his tears spilled onto the sword, which lay beside the noble’s body.<br />The sword’s faint light intensified, illuminating the area.

	<h4>With Light Comes Loyalty</h4>
	<strong>Unlock at Lv10</strong>
	<br /><br />
	Surprised by the sudden change in the sword, the knight picked it up and swung at the incoming horde. The sword let out a flash of light, wiping out the enemy forces.<br />Perhaps this was the first time the true power of the Thunderstone Luster had been unleashed.<br /><br />The knight returned to the kingdom and headed to Mordana Castle in order to report the outcome of the battle, but once there, he happened upon an utterly shocking sight.<br />A certain noble’s daughter had incurred the God of Ruin’s wrath, which was why the god had targeted their kingdom. Therefore, the kingdom’s inhabitants felt wronged by the royalty and nobility, calling them traitors who had sold out their own people.<br />A nationwide revolt had surged toward the castle all at once.<br /><br />Though reluctant to turn his blade against citizens of the kingdom, the knight was a servant of royalty, and he had no choice but to fight them.<br />He had wholeheartedly believed that serving the king meant serving the kingdom, so the sight of the citizens baring their fangs came as a huge shock which threatened his core beliefs and weakened his blade.<br /><br />“What does it truly mean to protect the kingdom…?”<br /><br />After all, he had sworn to do so, but he was now about to raise a hand against its people. All this had stemmed from the God of Ruin’s wrath…<br /><br />At that moment, the knight had an epiphany: perhaps the god’s true intention was to stir up the anxiety and dissatisfaction of the people in order to turn mankind against itself. His convictions reaffirmed, the knight swung the sword imbued with the gem’s divine protection.<br />He intended to de-escalate the situation by destroying the rebels’ weapons and convincing them to abandon their rebellion. While he may have been on the side of the royal family, the knight’s words were full of compassion for both the kingdom and its citizens, and so those in the rebel army gradually opened their hearts to him.<br /><br />However, at the very last moment, one of the God of Ruin’s underlings – disguised as a rebel – ended the knight’s life.<br />The flames of rebellion were fanned once more with carefully crafted words: “Our rebellion is a fight for justice!” <br />And so, the march continued. <br /><br />The follower’s real goal was to retrieve the sword which posed such a significant threat. As the rebel army moved on, the enemy in disguise approached the knight’s body and reached for the sword. Just then, a bolt of lightning came down from the heavens, striking and killing the follower.<br />Then both the sword and its owner’s body vanished.
