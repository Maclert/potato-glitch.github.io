	<h4>Birth of the Pirate King</h4>
	<strong>Unlock at Lv10</strong>
	<br /><br />
	What follows is a summary compiled from notes which I made while aboard Captain Doura's pirate ship, the Legnis.<br />The good captain informed me that he was originally a first officer in the navy of the Holy Kingdom of Odal. According to his own account, Captain Doura was repeatedly denied promotion due to his familial background, despite being more than competent enough as a captain.<br /><br />Yet soon the troubled captain's life took a sudden turn that would change everything. His ship, one of the Holy Kingdom's finest, was attacked by a pirate ship.<br />As his ship sunk and his body was thrown into the raging sea, Captain Doura was sure he was done for. Just as all seemed lost, he heard a voice emanating from the seabed.<br /><br />"Should you help me realize my wish, I shall save your life and grant you a ship which sunk into these depths long ago."<br /><br />Having heard the plea of the mysterious voice, the captain vowed that he would fulfil its wish.<br />Just then, a ship suddenly emerged from the sea floor and the captain was guided aboard. Before he knew it, the man formerly known as First Officer Doura discovered that he was enrobed in pirate regalia and was now the spitting image of a pirate captain.<br />Thus began the career of the infamous Pirate King Doura, captain of the Legnis.<br /><br />Though he now enjoyed a level of freedom unthinkable for one of his former position, the newly crowned Pirate King was now duty bound to carry out a new mission.<br />Namely, Captain Doura was now compelled to search the seas for the treasures which the voice at the bottom of the sea had charged him with finding.<br />In exchange for having become captain of the Legnis, Captain Doura would have to find four treasures scattered across the sea and deliver them unto his new master: the voice at the bottom of the sea.<br />Should he abandon his mission, he would enjoy a reunion with his now dead compatriots at the bottom of a watery grave.<br /><br />Torn between his newfound freedom as well as his new obligation to seek out treasure, the good captain set out on a journey that would define the next chapter of his life.

	The four treasures that Captain Doura sought were a set of legendary items which reportedly granted the Wealth of the Sea to any who managed to collect them.<br />Though the exact nature of the latter was unknown, if nothing else at least the names of the four treasures were known.<br /><br />In no particular order, they were: "The Sword with the Power to Calm the Waves”, “The Compass which Reveals the Location of Treasure”, “The Herb that Enables Undersea Breathing for a Limited Time”, and “The Key which Unlocks the Wealth of the Sea”.<br />Obtaining the Wealth of the Sea required that he first acquire all of the above treasures, but the captain claimed that even if he had not been forced by the seabed voice to collect them, as a man of the sea he felt compelled to seek out the four treasures.<br /><br />It was thus that I and a company of other sailors set out with the captain on his search for treasure, but we met with a series of setbacks as we sought out the four artifacts with nothing to go on except the words of an ancient legend.<br /><br />Thinking that it made the most sense to obtain the compass first, we began our search looking for that artifact which would guide us to the other treasures.<br />We eventually gleaned that the compass was inside the belly of a gargantuan beast, and set out to retrieve it while the monster was asleep.<br />At the captain's orders, we slaved for many an hour to prepare a huge feast that would fill up the beast's belly and lull him into a deep slumber.<br /><br />Even after obtaining the compass, we met with challenge after challenge at each of our subsequent destinations, but overcame each as well as gathered the treasure per the captain's wishes.<br />While we did everything in our power to aid the captain in his quest, I still remember clearly that our enthusiasm and determination were far eclipsed by that of the captain each time we arrived in the vicinity of a new artifact.

	Having already ridden through an uncountable expanse of rough sea, the captain had finally collected all four treasures.<br />I can still remember like it was yesterday: surrounded by countless other treasures which he had collected on his sojourn, the captain was a picture of mirth as he indulged himself in drink.<br />The captain was of course not alone in his celebration as the rest of his crew belted out sea shanties extolling the pirate life, flagons of grog held high in their hands.<br /><br />However, those happy days did not endure long. No sooner did the captain hand over the four treasures than the owner of the voice emanating from the seabed revealed its true nature.<br />The mysterious entity was in fact a demon of the sea. Now in a relatively weakened state, the demon sought to use the power of the seabed treasures to recover its power and once again establish its dominion over the oceans.<br /><br />Once recovered to something resembling its former potency, the demon conjured up a fearsome gale to wipe out those who made their living at sea.<br />'The demon is now running amok because of me...'<br />Even after having come to the above horrible realization, the captain kept his thoughts to himself as he was wont to do. Despite his horror, the captain showed no signs of weakness to his crew. Even now, I can hear his booming voice.<br /><br />"The seas of the world are our seas! They belong to no one man. They are for everyone. I'll be damned if I let anyone get away with taking them all for himself! Come on you louts! What are you waiting for? Raise our flag!"<br /><br />As the captain shouted his orders the flag of the Legnis climbed above the stormy waves and the ship turned as we prepared to pursue the demon.<br />We no longer had a compass to guide us to treasure. Yet the captain steered his vessel without hesitation, taking us on an inexorable course forward with just one target in mind.<br /><br />I was the only one left behind at the nearest port city.

	I am now endeavoring to write as much of my account down while safe in this port city.<br />First, I feel obligated to begin with the fact that the captain let me and me alone off the ship. The captain was of course aware that I was compiling a chronicle of our voyages up to this point.<br />Perhaps it was because he knew that he told me the following as he let me off the ship.<br /><br />"Your mission is to testify to our efforts, to our very existence."<br /><br />I imagine that the captain was considering the possibility that he may not return to port alive. However, I believed that he would.<br />I believed that someday he would reappear and tell me the harrowing tale of the demon's demise at the hands of the captain and his crew.<br /><br />Eventually, I thought, the storm would abate and the threat posed by the demon would forever be banished from the seas.<br />However, the captain never returned.<br />Could it be that the he and the crew of the Legnis had made the ultimate sacrifice to defeat the demon? I wandered around town trying to find any information I could about the Legnis or her crew, but ultimately came up empty-handed.<br /><br />Suddenly, I could hear the captain's words as though he were still standing next to me.<br />My mission was not to find them.<br />I decided to focus on compiling my notes of past voyages to tell the story of Legnis and the Pirate King to any who would listen.<br /><br />One day, as I was regaling a crowd of townspeople of the adventures of the pirate ship Legnis and Captain Doura, I suddenly became aware of the sounds of cheerful singing barely audible in the distance.<br />I excitedly tracked down a small child who had been humming the familiar tune and asked him where he had heard it.<br />The child's answer surprised me.<br /><br />"Sometimes I see this ship on the distant horizon. I was just imitating the song that I thought I heard them singing. Even though I could barely see the ship, the song was clear as a bell!"<br /><br />The song was none other than that which had once been sung by the captain long ago, glass raised in one hand while he beheld the treasures which surrounded him.
