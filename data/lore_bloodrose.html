	<h4>Bloodied Roses</h4>
	<strong>Unlock at Lv10</strong>
	<br /><br />
	Stories of long ago speak of a mysterious individual who spread terror throughout the Holy Kingdom of Odal.<br />This person would only venture out to kill at night when a red moon was in the sky, taking many lives, both man and beast alike.<br />Records from that time speak of unique aesthetics the killer sought out when taking the lives of victims, following an uncommonly rigid method of killing to achieve them.<br /><br />A certain knight of the kingdom was asked to investigate this eccentric killer to ultimately bring him to justice.<br />The knight's investigation exposed the killer as the eldest son of an aristocratic family.<br />This man was accomplished in both military and literary arts, quite personable in the community, and known for his gentle, yet sociable nature, with a promising future.<br /><br />But that was simply a facade, covering his lust for blood as a brutal killer, taking the lives of so many in such bizarre ways.<br />Once exposed, the killer fled from the kingdom to avoid facing justice at the hands of the knight. Even still, he would travel the world to repeatedly slaughter more victims.<br /><br />How could a man such as this, brought up in a well-to-do family of aristocrats, turn to a life of unspeakable crimes? Researchers have been debating this for years, but no clear motive was found.<br />After he fled from the kingdom, local citizens gave him a name, based on a plant found in his mansion and his reputation as a killer.<br />They called him 'Blood Rose'.

	<h4>Chasing the Murderer</h4>
	<strong>Unlock at Lv30</strong>
	<br /><br />
	Blood Rose and his whereabouts after fleeing from the kingdom are documented in records taken by a certain scholar of magic.<br />This scholar had his own way of doing things, and was not the type to be tracking down a serial killer.<br /><br />But as fate would have it, he happened upon a young female entertainer about to lose her life to Blood Rose, and rescued her. This is most likely what sparked his unlikely quest to track down a killer.<br />Yet, the one who actually expressed a clear motive for finding the killer was the young female entertainer who was nearly killed.<br /><br />It's not clear why the killer attacked her in the first place, but her testimony is included in the magic scholar's book of notes.<br /><br />"You want to know why I was attacked?<br />Well, I had that same question so I asked him during the incident. I said, 'Surely you're assaulting me because of my beauty." And how do you think that brute responded?<br />He said, 'You have no concept of true beauty.' Can you believe the nerve of that jerk!? I'm the number one idol in all of Granzelia, so what he said is unforgivable. I'll make sure he's brought to justice for his crimes!"<br /><br />Thus, the two of them set out to capture Blood Rose.<br /><br />A part of him welcomed this idol in hot pursuit, because the thought of carving her up into pieces excited him.<br />But the scholar of magic would often appear and foil his murderous intentions with other victims as well, which must have been quite bothersome.

	<h4>Piercing Aesthetics</h4>

	<br /><br />
	At his core, Blood Rose had a gentle demeanour and open mind as both an aristocrat and a killer. He would even deal with his murder victims in a polite, meticulous manner.<br />But an exception to this was the sudden rage he felt regarding actions that are not aesthetically pleasing.<br /><br />An example of this would be another killer on the loose during that same period in time, known for his man-eating activities. He was called the Man Muncher, with a history of chewing people up into messy pieces to fulfil his personal cravings.<br />Blood Rose considered this an incorrigible act, and was disgusted by the thought of being lumped into the same 'killer' category as this "uncivilized thug".<br /><br />Eventually his disgust morphed into a desire to kill, as Blood Rose became obsessed with putting an end to the Man Muncher, challenging him many times to a fight to the death.<br />Bits and pieces of the history between these two killers can be found in the notes left by the magic scholar on Blood Rose's trail.<br /><br />"As usual, I was pursuing Blood Rose based on the eyewitness accounts the girl had compiled. Soon I found him engaged in combat with a man swinging a hammer. It was quite shocking, really. The man with the hammer was muttering 'I'm hungry' while dodging every one of Blood Rose's attacks.<br />Someone who's only dabbled in defensive magic such as myself could never dream of participating in a battle as intense as this."<br /><br />The magic scholar just happened to witness this battle while pursuing Blood Rose, but no other account of these two killers locked in battle is thought to exist.<br />Other than the killers themselves, no one knows how it ultimately ended between them.

	<h4>Remaining Mysteries</h4>
	<strong>Unlock at Lv80</strong>
	<br /><br />
	Blood Rose killed continuously based on unique aesthetics.<br />Most think it was done for pleasure, to satisfy his fundamental nature as a killer. But research in recent years suggests he may have been working to accomplish a clear goal, by collecting blood on nights lit by a red moon.<br /><br />This new theory suddenly surfaced based on records discovered in the Holy Kingdom of Odal, from Blood Rose's time as an aristocrat, which are thought to have been penned by the killer himself.<br />The records are engraved with the name he used during his time as an aristocrat, along with some fascinating information.<br /><br />“...And then, I found the relic in one of the rooms at my mansion. I cannot allow it to stay hidden. I must unleash its power. Even if it means soiling my reputation as an aristocrat of the kingdom.”<br /><br />Although this is what is stated in the records, the style of writing and content are quite unlike anything else found from Blood Rose, leading to various debates on the topic.<br /><br />Some think it was written by an imposter, while other theories claim the 'relic' mentioned could have altered his personality, from aristocrat to killer.<br />Further research on the motive behind Blood Rose's actions will soon be carried out.<br /><br />Additionally, so many unknowns remain regarding his last days, including how and when he died.<br />Some theories postulate that he was captured and brought to justice by the magic scholar, or he died in battle with minions of the God of Ruin.<br />One thing for sure is that all accounts of Blood Rose as a killer come to an abrupt halt exactly five years after the first incident.
