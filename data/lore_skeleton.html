	<h4>Awakened Dead</h4>
	<strong>Unlock at Lv10</strong>
	<br /><br />
	The souls of warriors who have died in battle have been known to reawaken either due to witchcraft or location-related factors.<br />Though many use the word 'reawakened' to describe this phenomenon, a reawakened warrior will no longer possess the memories and consciousness which he had in his former life, with only the reawakened fighting spirit left intact.<br /><br />It is also interesting to note that the skeleton and equipment which previously belonged to the reawakened soul are also made manifest in the above process. Even if the bones and equipment of the deceased are long gone, their skeleton will appear. Though a reawakened warrior will sometimes speak in mumbled sentences, these are simply fragments of the consciousness which existed prior to death, and such utterances can hardly be regarded as actual speech.<br /><br />Although the actual strength of the reawakened will depend on the state they were in before death, souls which manifest in the form of a skeleton generally correspond to someone who was less powerful both spiritually and physically in their former life.<br /><br />Although such specimens are produced by magical forces, if the skeleton or equipment which manifests is destroyed, the soul which temporarily inhabited them will lose its mortal vessel, and resume its eternal slumber.<br />In a later section below, we will summarize who scholars have come to the aforementioned conclusion. But before we get that far, it might behoove the reader to understand the story of the explorer who was responsible for identifying the first specimen of the so-called 'Awakened dead'.

	<h4>Approaching Footsteps</h4>
	<strong>Unlock at Lv30</strong>
	<br /><br />
	Our tale begins on a cold desert night. A team of explorers rushed toward their destination, lamps in hand. Suddenly, they came upon what appeared to be a human silhouette in front of them, though the darkness made it impossible to make out the figure clearly.<br />Although it was the dead of night, the figure did not appear to have a lamp of any kind, nor did it appear he was attempting to make camp.<br /><br />“Perhaps this fellow has been injured?”<br /><br />The explorers could only speculate to themselves as they shook their lamps back and forth, and called out to the silhouette in front of them, trying to determine whether or not it was in danger. Suddenly, the silhouette started to approach the group.<br /><br />The speed at which it moved was something no normal human could have achieved, and before they knew it, the silhouette was bearing down on them. Straining their eyes to make out exactly what was in front of them, explorers were taken aback when what appeared before them was not a man, but a monster made entirely of bones, its jaw clicking menacingly. Naturally, the explorers panicked and fled the scene immediately.<br /><br />This was the first sighting of a particular type of demon now commonly known as Skeleton. At the time of our story, however, the demon which accosted the group of explorers was known as a 'monster', so the latter term is used here.

	<h4>Exterminating Monsters</h4>
	<strong>Unlock at Lv50</strong>
	<br /><br />
	Sightings of monsters made entirely of bones have for a long time been reported in many different locations, including deserts, plains, mountains and forests. Such monsters would apparently appear without warning and accost any witnesses present in the immediate area.<br />Testimony collected from many such incidents has always one thing in common: the monsters appeared to possess weapons and armor typical of a warrior.<br /><br />A warrior hailing from a certain country, who heard stories of these incidents, made a name for himself by slaying such monsters. No sooner had he started searching the vicinity of where a sighting was reported to have been made, than the rumored monster appeared. As the warrior confronted the monster, he realized that the monster appeared to be muttering indistinctly about something.<br /><br />Though the warrior tried to ask the monster what the latter was trying to say, the monster was entirely unfazed, and immediately launched into an attack on the warrior. Inevitably, the warrior gave up on further dialogue and took his sword to the monster. Blows which should have penetrated the monster's bones simply slipped through, and the monster remained unharmed.<br /><br />Still, the warrior was able to fend off the attacking monster and succeeded in knocking down the monster's sword and shield. The now disarmed monster stopped moving suddenly, and began to grow indistinct, before finally losing its shape and disappearing completely.

	<h4>Truth Survey</h4>
	<strong>Unlock at Lv80</strong>
	<br /><br />
	After the above battle between the warrior and the monster, an investigation of the surrounding area was conducted.<br />The results of the investigation showed that the area was previously a large battlefield where many warriors sacrificed their lives in battle and a below-ground survey revealed various bones and weapons belonging to the fallen.<br /><br />Thereafter, additional, highly thorough investigations were conducted in other areas where the monster was reportedly spotted. It was concluded that the areas all had in common the fact that they were old battlefields across which the bodies of many a warrior had been scattered and left to rot.<br /><br />The phenomenon of monsters bearing weapons appearing in places that were previously battlefields, attracted the interest of scholars in various fields, as well as certain specialists who apparently traveled en masse to villages and towns close to where the monsters had previously been discovered.<br /><br />Thanks to the efforts of such enthusiasts, we now know that monsters such as those described above appear due to location-related factors and the workings of witchcraft.
