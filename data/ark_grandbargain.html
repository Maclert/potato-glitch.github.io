	<h4>The Food Festival</h4>
	<strong>Unlock at Lv2</strong>
	<br /><br />
	The area around the Crowded City Badaal in Aldana serves a traditional full course meal known as the Food Festival.<br />Many dishes containing the meat of wild game hunted in the mountains, fish caught from the sea, and fruits picked fresh from the forest, are laid across the table in an extravagant display.<br />This full course meal is typically saved for celebrations or treating large groups, as it is customary for a group of anywhere from 5 to 10 men to eat the food over the course of a day.<br /><br />It’s said that those who eat every last bite are called masters of the mountains (animals), sea (fish), and forest (fruits), and that they will be blessed with bountiful hunts, net hauls, and harvests in the coming season.<br />Of course, this is nothing more than a superstition, but there are many who swear the meal has benefited their harvests. Nowadays, some villages will have events with eating contests where people will compete to see who can eat an entire Food Festival the quickest.<br /><br />Incidentally, the chefs cook the meat, fish, and fruits whole so you can see each individual ingredient that has gone into the dishes. And while cooked whole, each ingredient is properly seasoned, satisfying even the pickiest of gastronomes.

	The creator of this culinary tradition was an exceptional genius chef hailing from Mordana. Her name was Elfa.<br />One day, she received an order from a village called Talsa, which was not far from the Crowded City Badaal. The order was to cook a feast that would be the centerpiece of the village festival.<br />Talsa was a naturally abundant village but had no unique products to call its own. And despite its proximity to Badaal, it was not conveniently located enough to commute between the two.<br />As a result, Talsa’s population had been declining over the years. Distressed by their situation, the village mayor wanted to revitalize the village and so ordered a feast from Elfa, who had been gaining popularity at the time.<br />Elfa would often head out to remote areas to create unexpected food out of unexpected ingredients. Through her travels, she had heard of the village’s ample natural resources, so she immediately accepted the request.<br /><br />Once she arrived at the village, Elfa greeted the village mayor and quickly went to investigate what ingredients she could find. She looked for things that could only be found in the village, but unfortunately found nothing of the sort. However, what she did find was an abundance of animals, fish, and fruits.<br />Next, Elfa, investigated the preferred flavors of the region, but once again, could not find anything particularly unique.<br />After careful consideration, Elfa’s answer was to cook a great variety of dishes with an equal variety of flavors.<br />Naturally, the kitchen she used for the day of the festival ended up overflowing with mountains of food. When the festival opened at noon, the villagers were shocked to see the copious heaps of cuisine.<br />Though each individual dish had a rather ordinary concept, they all tasted delicious, and by the time night fell, the villagers had finished every last one.<br />Elfa entrusted the recipes to the village, and every year, they would recreate the gigantic feast. Word soon spread, and swarms of people began to visit the village.<br /><br />As time passed, the village’s festival feast would spread as a full course meal throughout the surrounding region until it became considered local cuisine in the Crowded City Badaal.<br />However, since the sheer amount of food Elfa had cooked was not easily offered on demand, the dishes became simpler and simpler as the tradition spread. The gargantuan feast was gradually toned down to an amount suitable for a single table.

	The Food Festival had become a culinary tradition in the area around Crowded City Badaal, but it was actually the cutthroat Goroth who made it famous throughout the nation.<br />Goroth loved eating the Food Festival, and even as a wanted criminal, he was said to hide out in a familiar restaurant so he could order it. Normally, people would avoid things that outlaws enjoyed… but many citizens were curious as to why a wanted criminal would be so desperate to eat something.<br />So, people began to try it themselves, then heaping praise upon it once they had eaten it, causing a super-effective feedback loop.<br /><br />The chef who had made the dish for Goroth had this to say:<br />“Oh, that man? The first time I met him was actually behind the restaurant.<br />I was in the middle of carrying ingredients through the back door into the kitchen when I found him crouching in the back alley. He was greedily eyeing the beef I was holding.<br />His eyes looked so pitiful that I couldn’t help but give him a small scrap.<br />The next day, I cooked up a specially ordered Food Festival, and when I took my eyes off it, that man came into the kitchen and ate the whole thing.<br />I was shocked… Dumbfounded, really.<br />That’s supposed to feed ten people over the course of an entire day, and he ate it all by himself. It couldn’t have taken more than ten minutes or so.<br />And you wanna know what he said after he was done eating?<br />‘Seconds, please.’<br />There was nothing I could do but laugh.”

	The chef’s testimony continued.<br />“While I had an awkward chuckle over it, it was really no laughing matter. After all, it was a special order I’d taken far in advance and lovingly prepared, and then it was gone just like that.<br />It costs quite a bit of money to get the ingredients for just one Food Festival.<br />Of course, we don’t take money from the customers beforehand, so it put us firmly in the red.<br />I told him this:<br />‘If you wanna eat, you gotta pay!’<br /><br />And what do you think he did?<br />The next day, he came right up to me and gave me the money, just like I asked. And, well, you know, it’s not like I can turn down a paying customer. So I quickly scrounged up the ingredients and started cooking again.<br />It takes a lot of time and effort to make a Food Festival, but he patiently waited the whole time. He didn’t try to sneak a single bite before it was ready.<br /><br />Hm? Did I know he was ‘Goroth’?<br />Hell no.<br />All he ever said was ‘I’m hungry’ or ‘Seconds, please.’<br />…But I did kinda get the feeling there was something sketchy and criminal about him. Just kinda had that aura.<br /><br />Why did I still feed him if he gave me a bad feeling?<br />Because he had money. I can’t turn down a paying customer, remember?<br />I’m a chef.<br />I don’t care who you are. If you pay me, I’ll feed you.”
