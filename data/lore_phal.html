	<h4>Dazzling Archer</h4>
	<strong>Unlock at Lv10</strong>
	<br /><br />
	An archeress who rapidly rose to prominence during the great war between the God of Ruin and humanity. She is notable for defeating many of the god’s followers.<br /><br />Her activity was first noted in the period when humanity first cast off the God of Ruin’s yoke. Around this time, countless small scale battles broke out between the two opposing forces. One well-known incident occurred when forces of the Holy Kingdom Odal were marching through Aldana’s Malboria Wetlands, only to be ambushed by the Logseusans. They failed to escape and were encircled.<br /><br />The Odalian commander had a choice: he could attempt a doomed retreat, or he could attempt to take down a few final enemies before inevitable death. Before the commander could decide, though, a ray of light tore through the forest and air. It seared through a soldier of the God of Ruin, who fell dead before he could even scream. Those present were still dumbstruck with confusion when in the following moment, one Logseusan after another was pierced by beams of light.<br /><br />The Odalian soldiers realized that an ally was providing them with suppressive fire. The God of Ruin’s troops were shocked by this surprise attack, which the Odalian soldiers successfully used to retreat to the forest. There they witnesses a young woman who wielded a mechanical bow. The Odalian commander thanked her for saving them, and asked her name. However, the young lady wasn’t interested in giving an answer.<br />“Glad to see you made it.”<br /><br />And that was all she said before taking off like the wind. The Odalians had many questions about the young lady’s identity, who in time would become a world-renowned figure by the name of “Phal”.

	<h4>Mechanical Bow Lumiere</h4>
	<strong>Unlock at Lv30</strong>
	<br /><br />
	Phal roamed the world. Sometimes she would join the rebel forces against the Logseusans; other times she would work as a hired bow, shooting arrows of light from her mechanical bow with unparalleled precision. In those days, mechanical weapons were so rare that Phal was seen as extraordinary for having one. No one knew how she came by it; however, the reason she used it was recorded by a comrade, Ignis:<br /><br />“I tried using the bow that my guru left to me. But I wasn’t meant to inherit it, and its power began fizzling out. That felt like a message that I should move on to a bow of my own. Since I’m a loyal student, I followed the message and made Lumiere mine.”<br /><br />There was once a short-lived rumor that Phal owed her achievements to the incredible ability of Lumiere, and without it her skills in archery were no better than average. But once while Phal was resting, a spy managed to escape quite a distance before anyone realized, forcing Phal to immediately make do with a common bow. Despite the great distance, she pierced the spy’s leg with a single arrow, proving that her archery skills were identical with or without Lumiere.<br />“It’s really been quite a while since I used a wooden bow… well, whatever does the job.”

	<h4>Two Archers</h4>
	<strong>Unlock at Lv50</strong>
	<br /><br />
	The best-known marksman from mankind’s great war against the God of Ruin – if not Phal – was surely Princess Lilah, the Holy Kingdom Odal’s first princess. Although both participated in countless battles across the world, the two reportedly never met. However, historical records suggest that they were very conscious of each other.<br /><br />One story relates to how Lilah and her royal guards were on their way to join the Lanzelian Kingdom’s forces as reinforcements. One day the party were staying in a village in the Lanzelian mountains. To show her appreciation for the hospitality she received, she put on a stunning display of archery wherein she shot a bevy of arrows at a distant tree, hitting her mark each and every time.<br /><br />Once Lilah and guards had moved on, Phal happened to visit the same village. Learning of Lilah’s exploits, a grinning Phal stood in the same place as her and aimed at a tree even farther away. Needless to say, all her shots hit their marks perfectly.<br /><br />After the battle ended, Lilah and her guards again passed through the village on the return from Lanzelia. Learning of Phal’s exploits, a grinning Lilah stood in the same place and aimed at a tree even farther away. This time too, Lilah shot only bullseyes.<br /><br />A while passed, and Phal eventually visited the village again. Seeing the arrows Lilah shot on the second round, Phal was momentarily stunned before she burst into delightful laughter.<br />“They don’t call that princess legendary for nothing.”<br /><br />Unfortunately, there is no record of whether Phal shot a second round of arrows.

	<h4>What's Inside Her</h4>
	<strong>Unlock at Lv80</strong>
	<br /><br />
	Eventually, the war between humanity and the God of Ruin came to an end with the humans securing a narrow victory. As a hero of the great war Phal received invitations from the militaries of every land but declined them all. Her comrades looked at her in wonder, and asked Phal for why she didn’t choose any of them.<br />“Eh, I’ve been a wanderer ever since I was a kid. It’s not my style to stick to a group or settle down.”<br /><br />For a while after the war, Phal roamed the world, vanquishing Beasts and the remaining Logseusans. After completing this task, Phal would go on to spend her days hunting for ancient machinery in ruins across the world. In this field as well, she achieved some measure of success. As for her archery skills, legend has it that she passed on her skills to a certain tribe who worshipped a mythical bow as their supreme treasure.<br /><br />In later years, Phal would often receive interview requests from historians. As free-spirited as ever and unbound by punctuality, she would often simply skip the meeting they arranged. When she did appear, however, she would gladly answer any question. Asked why she chose to join the war against the God of Ruin, Phal thought for a moment and replied:<br /><br />“It’s hard to say for sure, but probably because that’s what my guru would do. My guru’s tribe had a custom where you have to travel around to save people – but I think if that never existed things would’ve been the same. Otherwise, I’m not who you’d pick as a traveling companion. I don’t worry about the details, but I took what my guru gave me and taught me and made it my own.”
