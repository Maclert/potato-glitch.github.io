	<h4>Cracks in the Armor</h4>
	<strong>Unlock at Lv2</strong>
	<br /><br />
	The Republic of Mordana once ruled the southwestern part of Granzelia. Notably, this country had many forts with which to defend itself, a number not far behind that of the powerful Holy Odal Kingdom at the time.<br /><br />After the war with the God of Ruin and the fall of the Republic, almost all of the forts were destroyed, but the histories of the battles at each fort have been retained. A typical example is the battle at Fort Beyganda.<br />After one particular event, the Republic was forced to fight against the God of Ruin. The forts were exposed countless times to the invasions of the divine Beasts, and they became crucial points of defense, swarming with soldiers.<br />Among them, the warriors of Fort Beyganda were a particularly sturdy group that would never succumb to defeat, no matter how numerous their opponents or how powerful the divine Beasts that appeared.<br />They took the burden of protecting their country with pride and fought to the bitter end.<br />And of all the long battles with the divine Beasts, Beyganda was the only fort to have successfully defended itself against every single attack, or so it goes.<br />At the time, people hailed the fort’s absolute defensive power, and gave it the second name of the Impenetrable Gate. With the warriors’ success, morale in the war against the God of Ruin skyrocketed, and it’s said that this led to a rise in volunteer soldiers standing up for the country’s victory.<br />The work of the warriors in the Impenetrable Gate brought them into view as heroes, and they became popular among children in urban areas, who played games that imitated the soldiers’ efforts, such as “Beyganda Tag”.

	<h4>Architect of Iron</h4>
	<strong>Unlock at Lv4</strong>
	<br /><br />
	The forts of the Republic were made by one particular architectural engineer.<br />This engineer was from a long line of military officers, but his mindset and physique did not lend themselves to such a calling, and he had apparently not been blessed with any battlefield talent.<br />However, he had remarkable talent for spatial recognition in his constructions, identifying necessary materials, and in judging the suitability of a location for building.<br /><br />The Republic regarded his skills very highly, entrusting the building of all forts to him, and giving him total authority. His architectural skills were wholly demonstrated in every fort he built. Later buildings based off his ideas have been particularly innovative, and even current architectural technology incorporates his skill.<br />His construction of these forts was a combination of his talent, and having grown up as a member of a family of military personnel, where he would hear battle stories as part of his daily life.<br />If either one of these factors had been missing, such a rare talent in architectural engineering would not have been born.<br /><br />Nowadays, people tend to particularly appreciate that the forts were systematically placed throughout the country.<br />He built forts that were strategic locations on their own, but he then established a characteristic connected network between them, creating an ironclad defense.<br />With this, even if one fort were to come under enemy attack, other forts could send reinforcements immediately.<br />While Fort Beyganda’s strong bones played a role in its ability to repel divine Beast invasions, more important was the nationwide defense network of forts.

	<h4>Inspiring Unity</h4>

	No matter how strong the fort was, without the general who protected it, Fort Beyganda would not have been able to boast an undefeated record as the Impenetrable Gate.<br />It has an inseparable connection to the soldier Adan, whose actions cannot be ignored.<br /><br />Records of Adan can only be found after he was sent to the front as fort commander. His struggles before he reached this station is somewhat of an enigma. Thus, the first half of his life has become legend.<br />Some stories say he was the secret child of a royal family who was given special education for soldiers, while others claim he is a demigod who was born to one god and one human parent.<br /><br />It’s said that he understood and used what the architect built as the fort’s mechanisms more than anyone.<br />Even if the enemy’s numbers outweighed their allied numbers, Adan piled up victories by using slits int he fort’s walls to rain volleys of arrows upon the enemy, or making use of nearby hill formations so as to have a one-sided view of his opponents.<br /><br />During one of his most famous battles in Beyganda, his forces were surrounded by a huge army of the God of Ruin’s followers. Even with an exhausted food supply, they endured three days and three nights and still fought off the enemy.<br />As a commander, Adan had a different character from other soldiers. When they had only a small amount of food, his subordinates encouraged him to eat, even if it would just be him alone.<br />However, he refused.<br />“Commanders of an army can’t just fill their own stomachs when their subordinates are suffering,” he said.<br />The soldiers who saw this were impressed by their commander’s sentiment, and united to endure the hunger.<br />Thus, the God of Ruin’s army, which believed the soldiers’ morale had declined, had the tables turned on them.

	<h4>Nameless Valor</h4>
	<strong>Unlock at Lv10</strong>

	Currently, there is an outfit known as the Beygandian Garb. These clothes are modeled after the garb of warriors who supported the communications network between the forts at the time.<br />There were liaison personnel in each fort, but there is one particular reason behind the popularity of the Beyganda liaison’s uniform.<br /><br />Once, when the God of Ruin’s followers advanced upon Beyganda, a liaison officer was dispatched at the command of Adan to seek reinforcements from other forts. The enemy forces had encircled the fort with their great numbers, so it was extremely difficult for the officer to slip through the barrier.<br />But with deadly determination, he succeeded in forcing his way through and managed to reach the target fort. Once there, he confirmed the promise of reinforcements and he headed back to Beyganda.<br /><br />On the way back, however, he was caught by the enemy forces and forced to try and strike a deal.<br />“Stand in front of the fort and tell them reinforcements aren’t coming.<br />Demand they surrender.<br />If you do that, we will spare your life.”<br />The liaison officer responded that he would comply and went to the front of the fort.<br />And then he shouted to his allies inside,<br />“Reinforcements are coming soon! Hold out for that!”<br /><br />The army was enraged and killed the man on the spot. But this man’s willingness to protect his allies at the cost of his own life inspired Adan and all the other soldiers in the fort.<br />They fought hard, spurred on by the liaison’s last words, and when the reinforcements rushed in, the enemy finally withdrew.<br />The fort’s soldiers closed with a fantastic victory.<br />This story inspired an outfit based on what the liaison officer had worn, and it became revered as a symbol of a courageous heart.
