	<h4>Heavenly Angel</h4>
	<strong>Unlock at Lv2</strong>
	<br /><br />
	Before and after the great war between the God of Ruin and humanity, a divine being was sighted across Granzelia.<br />This being floated in the sky via its many wings and was bathed in a divine light. The being’s head in particular was the focus of that light, and it gave off a blinding brilliance.<br />Based on its appearance, this being was called an angel at the time.<br /><br />There are no records of it actively concerning itself with the matters of humans or Beasts living in Granzelia. Fierce battles between the hosts of humanity and the God of Ruin’s followers were unfolding all across the land at the time, but this being did not help either side. Instead, it kept a neutral position.<br />Did it actually possess any sort of power that could help either side?<br />It did, in fact.<br /><br />A company of knights from the Kingdom of Lanzelia happened to spot it as they marched over the snowy fields of their country.<br />They mistook it for one of the God of Ruin’s minions and decided to attack it. The knights vigilantly surrounded it and started their unified assault. However, this being didn’t seem phased in the slightest.<br />It merely raised its hand in a sweeping gesture. The next instant, a huge shockwave cracked the earth and leveled the entire company along with it.<br />There is still ongoing research about this being, but we still don’t know much about it, not even its true name. However, it’s clearly not such a minor creature that it could be called an angel.<br />Researchers agree that it was actually a god.

	Someone who saw this god, spoke years later:<br /><br />“In this one moment, we felt a refreshing gust of wind, and then far away, we saw what looked like an angel in the sky.<br />We couldn’t see its face because it was surrounded by light, but it kinda felt like it was smiling at us. Which reminds me, there was a human nearby who had wings like it did. It was a man – no, wait, maybe a woman?<br />They were too far off to tell, unfortunately.<br />Meanwhile, the angel-looking thing flew away, and then a little while later, there was a huge burst of light from that direction.<br />What in the world happened?”<br /><br />It is assumed that the place where this “burst of light” occurred is now part of the Lanzelia Mountains.<br />Since times of old, the Lanzelia Mountains have been known as the primary destination for people who want to train in swordsmanship.<br /><br />Yet another person saw this god while crossing the Great Sand Sea of Mordana.<br /><br />“I was stunned by it, and when I went to see where I thought it came from, I saw what looked like a glowing angel.<br />Though I’ve never seen a real angel before, so I could’ve been wrong.<br />But it was just… so beautiful. ‘Angelic’ is the only way I can describe it. I carefully made my way closer, but it immediately flew away.<br />Must’ve noticed me.<br /><br />Anyway, when I went to check out where I thought the angel had been, I saw what looked like a machine that had been blown to smithereens. It was giving off something that looked like smoke, so I’m pretty sure the angel must’ve blown it up.”<br /><br />A great number of machines can be found buried all over Granzelia; they are relics of the past. However, some have been found in such a state that they could not have been destroyed by human means.

	<h4>Hiring a Winged Being</h4>

	There are still many mysteries yet unanswered about this winged god, but some things have come to light thanks to research into literature and people’s testimonies from the time.<br />One thing we know now is that this god had several other winged servants that resembled it. There are more eyewitness accounts of these servants than the god who was their master.<br />Their appearance was said to be similar to their master’s in that they looked divine, but it was possible to make out the beautiful features of their faces.<br />However, according to those who had seen them up close, they said little and did not wear human-like expressions on their faces.<br /><br />Another thing we know about this god is that it gave the orders for its servants to eliminate specific people.<br />Their targets all had one thing in common: they were all from other worlds.<br /><br />There have been otherworlders since time immemorial. Among them was one who brought innovative technologies to our world. The tales of another otherworlder’s valor are still passed down even today.<br />However, the otherworlders who have stood at center stage in Granzelia’s history were just the tip of the iceberg.<br />There is conjecture that there were even more of these otherworlders, but that they had been secretly erased by this god and its servants.<br /><br />One famous tale tells of a powerful otherworlder who had been one of the god’s maximum priority targets. A fierce battle unfolded between the god’s winged servants and the otherworlder – a warrior who called himself a “samurai”.<br />But why was this god targeting and eliminating otherworlders?<br />We still do not know.

	<h4>Scholarly Reasoning</h4>

	A researcher named Daolon has been researching this god and the winged people who served it for many years.<br />He stated the following conclusions during a lecture held at the Imperial Scientific Society.<br /><br />“Based on this god’s behavior, I believe that he… or at least, I shall be calling him a ‘he’, must have been trying to protect our world from the imbalance that the otherworlders brought.<br />In other words, he was trying to restabilize the world.<br />It is clear that the technologies and abilities the otherworlders possessed far exceeded those of the people who lived in Granzelia at the time. With that in mind, we can say that this god was protecting us… nay, he was protecting the order of all of Granzelia, in a sense.<br /><br />What’s that?<br />How was he able to figure out who the otherworlders were so quickly?<br />Hmm… That’s a good question.<br />This is merely speculation on my part, but I believe that he may have had the power to control and guard the boundary that encircled Granzelia…<br />I guess we can call it the world boundary.<br />Furthermore, it’s possible this god had the power to cross between our world and other worlds.”<br /><br />This god has not been sighted since the great war against the God of Ruin. One theory suggests that it was destroyed by one of its winged servants, but we have no conclusive evidence of this.
