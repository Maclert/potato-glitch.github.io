	Seilios, knight of the Mordanian Kingdom, is commonly known for accompanying the White Knight Melza on her quest to defeat the God of Ruin. From the tales of that time, people came to call him by such epithets as the “Ice Emperor” and the “Icy Guardian.” His swordplay was supremely refined during his time in Mordana, overshadowing that of even his master Melza.<br /><br />Among the anecdotes of Seilios’ time in Mordana is the following: immediately before becoming a knight, Seilios accompanied his friends into a certain forest, where they played a variety of games. On their way home, the group had the misfortune to encounter a beast. While his friends were paralyzed with fear, Seilios grabbed a stick from the ground and stepped towards the creature. <br />The beast attacked again and again with its razor-like claws, which Seilios parried swiftly. When the beast was momentarily careless, he counterattacked without missing a beat. Realizing that there was no way it could win, the beast lost its will to fight and fled. Seilios was wholly unharmed and succeeded at protecting all of his friends. He was only 13 years of age at the time.<br />The following day, one of the friends asked Seilios, “Weren’t you afraid?”<br />This was how he answered:<br /><br />“I have trained myself to become a knight. But if I had been killed there, I never would have been able to grow into a man. It seems, though, that I do have what it takes to become a knight. I almost feel grateful to the monster who made that clear to me.”

	<h4>Hero’s Tales</h4>

	One indication of the White Knight Melza’s endearing nature is the many heroic legends featuring her, some of which are based on historical fact and others of which are the invention of later generations. Similarly, a plethora of tales have been spun about Melza’s compatriots, Seilios and the swordsman of flame.<br /><br />On account of his concern with propriety, Seilios was particularly beloved by women, and he was portrayed in a variety of romantic scenarios. Incidentally, most fictional tales about the swordsman of flame are swashbuckling adventures written for young men, which suggests a contrast between the two knights that is borne out by the historical records.<br /><br />Of those tales that feature Seilios as their main character, “Blue Ice Serenade” by Chirusse is consistently regarded as the magnum opus. The story traces Seilios’ pursuit of his liege Melza from Mordana onward. Before long, a feudal lord invites Seilios to his manor, and during his stay of several days Seilios finds himself receiving affection from the lord’s daughter, Tilme.<hr />Considering Seilios’s plans to leave the manor the following day, Tilme could almost feel her heart rend in two. “Seilios! You must know that my heart is…”<br /><br />Tilme rushed to Seilios, throwing herself into his arms. Sensing her warmth, her scent, and her body pressed against his, Seilios for a moment almost embraced her. However, he knew that would have been unacceptable, as he had a mission that needed to be prioritized above all else – he must find his master Melza and work beneath her.<br /><br />“Lady Tilme…”<br /><br />Reluctantly, as if trying to push away heartbreak, Seilios placed his hands on Tilme’s shoulders and pushed her away.<br /><br />“I am in the midst of a journey to seek my master. I have no time to think of anything else.”<br /><br />“…”<br /><br />Tilme was unable to speak a word. She knew from the beginning that Seilios would reject her on account of his mission. That, in fact, is why she came to care for him in the first place. She took another step away from him and spoke:<br /><br />“When your mission is complete, please return to this manor.”<br /><br />Seilios, unable to answer, looked down at the floor. Seeing this, Tilme, smiling sadly, opened her mouth to speak again.<br /><br />“That wasn’t very nice of me to say, was it? It's been a pleasure to meet you, Seilios."<br /><br />Without waiting for a response, she turned back around and left silently.<br /><br />– Excerpted from the final chapter of “Blue Ice Serenade,” ‘Day before Departure’

	Dailuze’s book “Ice and Blackflame: Lougseusean Warrioress” centers on Seilios, and it’s exceptional even among related works. The reason for this is that the woman who falls in love with Seilios is a warrior in the army of the God of Ruin.<br /><br />While the volcanoes of Malboria were erupting, Seilios and Amelia locked swords. Each of them was entirely sincere about their attempt to defeat the other, but all the same their bladework seemed reticent.<br /><br />“Why do you appear before me?! If you had never shown yourself, I would have been able to slay the humans for Lougseus’ sake without a second thought.”<br /><br />She seemed to half-scream those words. Seilios, however, had no response for them. He was the one who asked Amelia to stop slaughtering humankind.<br /><br />She felt at a complete loss anywhere other than in the army of Lougseus.<br /><br />“But still, for you I feel so…”<br /><br />With an anguished expression, Seilios reached his hand out. Amelia brushed it off and moved away.<br /><br />“Stop! You’ve already been too kind to me!!”<br /><br />– Excerpted from “Ice and Blackflame: Lougseusean Warrioress, Chapter 4: Locking Blades, Opposed Emotions”

	<h4>A Portrait</h4>
	<strong>Unlock at Lv10</strong>
	<br /><br />
	Seilios became a semi-legendary figure in the tales of later generations, but the historical Seilios was known to be a handsome figure popular among the opposite sex. It seems that this didn’t concern him, however, since his single-minded devotion to Melza gave him no room for women in his heart apart from her.<br /><br />All the same, from the time that he traveled together with Melza, Seilios’s appearance and swordsmanship were subjects of discussion among many people, which inspired artists of all sorts to seek him out.<br /><br />Wishing to sing of Seilios’s feats, one bard requested an audience with him; hoping to paint his portrait, an artist visited Seilios while he was traveling. Seilios, however, had no desire to be discussed and refused them all.<br /><br />“I should prefer that they learn of Lady Melza. She, more than any other, is fit to be our – nay, all the world’s instructor.”<br /><br />Of course, to this, Melza responded, “There’s no better way to have people learn about our mission to defeat the God of Ruin. Let them join us every once in a while.” And so Seilios reluctantly agreed to work together with such artists a number of times.<br /><br />Seilios generally preferred to avoid the spotlight, but he did enjoy a portrait that originally depicted him, Melza, and his compatriot known as the Swordsman of Flame. The artist seems to have gathered at some point that the two knights were not on good terms, and edited out the second knight. But it didn’t take much thought for Seilios to laugh and say, “It’s fine as it is.”
