	<h4>Castle of the Thunder God</h4>
	<strong>Unlock at Lv2</strong>
	<br /><br />
	The Sky Castle… A phantom castle in the age of mythology, looming far away in the sky.<br />In the center of the castle was a temple where the God of Thunder, who wielded immense power, would watch over the people. Whenever he found a blasphemer, he would gather the lightning of the heavens and smite them where they stood.<br />On the other hand, the God of Thunder favored divine and human heroes, and would sometimes invite those he found worthy up to his castle.<br />Upon their return, the heroes would tell stories of the Sky Castle to the people. As word of the castle spread, some people sought to confirm its existence for themselves, setting their sights far and high in the sky.<br />One such man who teamed up with a Beast to seek the Sky Castle had this to say:<br /><br />“Yeah. Me and my partner set our sights on the Sky Castle.<br />Bought us a fixer-upper of a skyship and begged my engineer of an old man to fix it up for cheap.<br />So we boarded the skyship and headed for the Sky Castle. My partner figured it’d be hidden in a big cloud, so we first flew at whatever big-ass thunderclouds we could find. But as we thought, the sky was treacherous.<br />It’s a miracle we didn’t crash.<br />On our second attempt, we tried going above the clouds and as stupidly high as we could. But as we got closer to the clouds, a weird wind blew us away.<br />So that was a no-go.<br />For our third attempt, wanna guess what happened?<br />Lightning.<br />There was only one cloud in the sky. A big-ass thundercloud way, way off in the distance.<br />And yet our skyship got struck by lightning right before we left.<br />The skyship was totaled.<br />That’s gotta be the God of Thunder’s way of tellin’ us to call it quits already.<br />But now I know for sure.<br />That Sky Castle’s hidden inside a cloud.”

	<strong>Unlock at Lv4</strong>

	It is said that the God of Thunder is still sitting on his throne in the Sky Castle, watching over the people, but legend has it that it took him many battles to earn that seat.<br /><br />The Sky Castle did not originally belong to the God of Thunder, but to his father, the God of Storms. However, the God of Storms would give in to his emotion and cause natural disasters upon the land, throwing the world into chaos.<br />This state of affairs distressed the Arch God, ruler of the Realm of Gods, and so he ordered the God of Thunder to usurp the God of Storms and take his place as overseer of the Sky Castle.<br />Naturally, the God of Storms would not hand over the castle without a fight. They fought an intense, drawn-out battle that showed no sign of ending. The God of Thunder, aiming to break the deadlock, commissioned the God of Blacksmithing to forge him a helmet of invisibility.<br />Donning his helmet, the God of Thunder sneaked up behind the God of Storms and slaughtered him with a single attack.<br /><br />The God of Thunder had finally become the owner of the Sky Castle, but many others sought to take his place. Among them was his older brother, the God of Swamps.<br />The God of Swamps feigned friendliness with the God of Thunder, and invited him to his home, the Castle in the Great Swamp. While the God of Thunder was traveling there, he was attacked by the Great Snake, a servant of the God of Swamps who had been waiting for him.<br />Lightning was forbidden in the swamp, and the God of Thunder was about to be eaten whole, but with his immense strength, he tore the Great Snake’s mouth in two and escaped danger.<br />Realizing this whole thing was a setup by the God of Swamps, the God of Thunder spread rumors of his own death by the Great Snake. He then made sure the God of Swamps was invited to the Sky Castle.<br />Once the God of Swamps arrived, the God of Thunder annihilated him with one strike of his Thunder Hammer.

	<h4>A Hero's Dilemma</h4>
	<strong>Unlock at Lv7</strong>
	<br /><br />
	The God of Thunder invited many heroes to his castle and granted them power, and among them was one warrior who had boldly fought Beasts beyond his capability.<br />His name was Lucido.<br />Lucido was a knight of a certain nation that had been enduring destruction by menacing Beasts.<br /><br />Human-Beast conflicts had been happening all over the world since time immemorial, but the Beasts in Lucido’s nation had organized, causing especially harsh damage.<br />It was assumed that a Beast with plenty of brain and brawn was behind the whole operation. Despite knowing citizens of remote villages were being overrun with Beasts, Lucido could not disobey the nation’s orders to prioritize defense of the cities, and he felt terribly frustrated.<br />But once the villagers reached the limit of damage they could sustain, Lucido broke away from his nation’s forces and resolutely stood up against the Beasts – alone.<br /><br />He first fought against a boar Beast that threatened a farm. Though it took the form of a boar, it was unmistakably a Beast.<br />The two adversaries differed in both size and strength. The Beast charged at him again and again, and each time, Lucido held fast, knowing he could die at any moment.<br />Eventually, however, the Beast crashed right into a large tree. Lucido took that opportunity to pierce the Beast between the eyes with his sword, just barely managing to defeat it.<br /><br />Though the villagers had never even considered fighting back previously, the sight of Lucido felling the boar Beast gave them courage.<br />Afterward, Lucido went on to defeat many more Beasts that oppressed the people, and at the same time, he taught the villagers the art of war. Through his teachings, all the villages began establishing militias which eventually expanded into a larger organization backed by Lucido himself.<br />Word of Lucido’s actions spread, and the people began to call him a hero. However, Lucido knew that he had no outstanding talents or abilities, and that all of his battles had resulted in narrow victories. He pushed back against his fame, and he could never shed his reluctance to challenge high-ranking Beasts.

	<h4>A Peal of Thunder</h4>
	<strong>Unlock at Lv10</strong>
	<br /><br />
	Someone had been watching over Lucido: the God of Thunder, sitting on his throne in the Sky Castle.<br />Impressed with Lucido’s ability to give hope to the people despite his lack of ability otherwise, the God of Thunder gave him the following oracle:<br /><br />“Thou may seeketh my Sky Castle.<br />Cometh here, and I shalt grant you great strength.”<br /><br />Upon hearing those words, Lucido desperately searched for the Sky Castle, paying a visit to someone who had previously sought it as well. While initially hesitant to talk, the adventurer had a change of heart upon learning Lucido had received an oracle, and thereafter told him that the Sky Castle was in the clouds.<br />Unable to give up his dream of reaching the Sky Castle, the adventurer had held onto a skyship, but he now turned it over to Lucido.<br /><br />“If anyone can reach it, it’s you. The god himself has invited you.<br />Take in every sight the Sky Castle has to offer, for the sake of all of us who cannot see it for ourselves.”<br /><br />Lucido was inexperienced with skyships, but felt oddly comfortable at the helm as he traveled.<br />The great thundercloud sucked the ship in as if showing him the way, and Lucido finally reached the Sky Castle.<br />When Lucido knelt before him, the God of Thunder looked at him with satisfaction and said nothing, simply pointing his finger toward the heavens.<br />Upon realizing that was a gesture to offer his sword, Lucido timidly raised his cherished sword on high.<br />Immediately, a roar echoed from the heavens, and lightning rained down upon Lucido… or so it appeared, but the lightning instead struck his sword.<br />Thus was the birth of the holy sword imbued with the power of the God of Thunder.<br /><br />Lucido returned to the surface, holy sword in hand, and went on to conquer Beast after Beast.<br />In the end, it is said that he even defeated the high-ranking Beast who had been the mastermind behind the villagers’ suffering.
