	<h4>Beast of Stone</h4>
	<strong>Unlock at Lv10</strong>
	<br /><br />
	Locals tell of rock-like beasts that inhabit the surrounding mountains. Their intelligence is limited and on par with most animals and in some cases may even be inferior to the same.<br /><br />Although it is not entirely impossible to communicate with them, they are not capable of speaking in human language. The beasts typically eat a diet of rocks and minerals and are often found sleeping in volcanic and rocky areas.<br />Because they do not have a ferocious nature, the beasts have seldom been seen to actively attack outsiders. However, when provoked or awakened from their slumber, they have been known to attack using their powerful bodies.<br />When sleeping, their appearance is almost indistinguishable from a typical boulder, so there have been many cases in which a traveler or such has been attacked after unintentionally stepping on a Dabourne and waking it up.

	<h4>Suicide Bomber</h4>
	<strong>Unlock at Lv30</strong>
	<br /><br />
	If you ever find yourself unfortunate enough to get into a scuffle with a Dabourne, it is important to avoid its self-destruct attack at all costs.<br />Dabourne are believed to store a tremendous amount of thermal energy inside their bodies, and are able to cause massive damage to their surroundings by unleashing said energy, at the expense of their life.<br />Interestingly, Dabourne, which are known to possess an extremely dangerous nature, have never been reported to explode directly due to an enemy attack.<br /><br />According to findings published by one beast scholar, the Dabourne have a detonator-like organ inside their bodies which can only be triggered of its own volition.<br />Although further research is required to confirm the above findings, it supports the common wisdom among adventurers that it is possible to prevent these beasts from self-destructing by defeating them quickly.

	<h4>Even Dragons Fear</h4>
	<strong>Unlock at Lv50</strong>
	<br /><br />
	The destructive power of a Dabourneâ€™s self-destruct technique is widely feared even among other beasts, which are generally known to avoid provoking the Dabourne. A traveler is reported to have spotted a massive dragon descending onto a close by mountaintop while attempting to pass over the Gragia Mountains.<br /><br />However, the unfortunate beast inadvertently woke up a sleeping Dabourne, and was predictably attacked by the Dabounre the moment it woke up. Of course, the dragon, being a dragon, could withstand almost any normal attack mounted against it. The dragon counterattacked and immediately brought the Dabourne to the brink of death.<br /><br />However, the moment that the Dabourne signaled it was about to self-destruct, the dragon became obviously anxious and agitated.<br />The dragon is said to have retreated far into the sky before flying away in terror.

	<h4>Saving Humans</h4>
	<strong>Unlock at Lv80</strong>
	<br /><br />
	On the other hand, there have also been reports of Dabourne rescuing humans from danger. Records tell of an adventurer who met with difficulty after setting foot in an untrodden remote region where there should have been no hope of rescue.<br />As the adventurer started to contemplate the inevitability of his death, he lay down quietly and waited for death. It was then that a Dabourne appeared. Though the adventurer was startled, he continued to steel his spirit for death.<br /><br />However, the Dabourne merely gave the adventurer a passing glance and did not attack. On the contrary, the beast picked up the adventurer in his arms and moved him to a place where humans frequently passed through. Shortly thereafter a man appeared and rescued the adventurer.<br />The adventurer shared his tale of how the Dabourne saved him, and his story became well known for the time.<br /><br />However, though Dabourne are less ferocious than many other beasts, they can hardly be described as friendly towards people. Now many scholars believe that the Dabourne may have simply been trying to remove the adventurer from an area it regarded as its bed.<br />
