	<h4>The Establishment of the Church of the Creator</h4>
	<strong>Unlock at Lv2</strong>
	<br /><br />
	The Great Temple Maja, located in the Imperial Capital of the Aldana Empire, serves as the headquarters and primary base of operations of the Church of the Creator. As the organization’s name implies, the Church of the Creator’s members worship the Creator God, and the organization itself represents the largest religious power in Granzelia, even as its membership continues to grow today.<br />The roots of the Church can be traced back to ancient times, to an era lost to myth when the Creator ruled the world.<br /><br />In that era when Granzelia was governed by the Creator, the people naturally worshiped the creator as a matter of common sense. Thus, these worshipers did not organize themselves into a “religion” as we know it today. However, there eventually emerged among the most devoted, those who sought to manage and control the people’s faith. These followers began to codify a highly organized religion around their belief system.<br />It was this proto-organization which eventually grew into the Church of the Creator we know today. Some historians refer to the organization which emerged during this period as the “Ancient Church of the Creator”.<br /><br />Thereafter, the Church of the Creator and its adherents enjoyed a period of relative stability and peace, but the Creator’s rule over the world eventually came to an end thanks to the scheming designs of the God of Ruin.<br />The God of Ruin came to rule over Granzelia, and the world entered a new era – an era worse than hell for those who still worshipped and served their beloved Creator.

	<h4>The Time of Troubles</h4>
	<strong>Unlock at Lv4</strong>
	<br /><br />
	As the new ruler of Granzelia, the God of Ruin naturally repudiated the Creator as an illegitimate ruler, and engaged in an intense campaign to repress and abuse the latter god’s followers.<br />Many such followers were captured by agents of the God of Ruin, or soldiers of the various nations which had already submitted to his rule. These followeres were publicly tortured as a warning to others; after which, many were subjected to all manners of cruel and unusual executions.<br />One of the most frequently used methods of execution was a ritual known as “Purification by Flame”. In this particularly cruel execution, followers of the Creator were crucified and made to beg their god for mercy, before being set alight and burning to death.<br />The objective of this gruesome display was to impress upon any remaining followers of the Creator, that their god would bring them no salvation, and as a result many gave up their faith and swore allegiance to the God of Ruin.<br /><br />Yet there were still some who continued to practice their religion in secret, away from the prying eyes of the God of Ruin and his agents. However, those who tried to preserve their religion were always at risk of being discovered, should their holy texts or any other tomes which spoke of the world before the God of Ruin’s dominion, be discovered by the God of Ruin’s forces.<br />Thus, with a heavy heart, the remaining faithful burned all such texts and the teachings of their religion were passed down through oral tradition alone. Some of the teachings of the Church of the Creator, which were transmitted through this oral tradition, have now started to attract attention not only from religious groups but also from historians and other researchers, as an important basis for reconstructing and understanding certain events which occurred during the time of the Creator’s reign over Granzelia.<br /><br />It later came to pass that the system by which the God of Ruin ruled over Granzelia was dismantled by human hands. Followers of the Creator seized the opportunity to revive and restart their organization. Some historians regard this period as a major turning point in the organization’s activities, and refer to the Church which existed under the rule of the God of Ruin as the Medieval Church of the Creator, and refer to the Church which emerged after the collapse of the God of Ruin’s rule as the “Contemporary Church of the Creator”.

	<h4>Restoration and Development</h4>
	<strong>Unlock at Lv7</strong>
	<br /><br />
	It is generally believed that the reason the Church of the Creator has been able to restore itself and continue to grow its membership after facing near extermination during the God of Ruin’s dominion over Granzelia, can be largely attributed to the Church’s early support for the Empire of Aldana.<br /><br />The Empire traces its origins to the Aldanian Army, which sought independence from the Holy Odal Kingdom, and it was during this initial struggle for independence that Aldana benefited from the support of the Church, which aided the Aldanian forces in battle. Although there were many elements in the Church which objected to the supporting of the Aldanian Army, their objections were assuaged by the “founding father” of the revived Church, a man known as Maja Reston.<br /><br />Maja Reston is said to have persuaded those who opposed supporting Aldana as follows:<br /><br />“Aldana’s people have long suffered under the tyranny of the Holy Kingdom. Their rebellion is right and just. On the other hand, the Holy Kingdom is now trying every measure they have to restore their rule over those who are trying to throw off the yoke of their tyranny.<br />It certainly seems like a familiar tale, doesn’t it?<br />What they are attempting does not meaningfully differ from the evil deeds perpetrated by the God of Ruin!<br />I would like to make a declaration here and now. Let me be clear: I shall give my unflagging support to Aldana’s war for independence! We shall visit upon the kingdom the same just punishment which we once visited upon the God of Ruin!”<br /><br />Aldana would eventually drive back the Holy Kingdom and succeed in establishing its independence. Mere decades later, Aldana annexed all the other nations of Granzelia and succeeded in unifying the world under one banner. The breakthrough success of this movement was supported in no small part by the power of the Church of the Creator, while on the other hand the Church benefited by the expansion of Aldana’s territory as it brought more and more believers into the fold.<br /><br />Later, Aldana established an imperial government to become the “Empire of Aldana”, and their congenial relationship with the Church of the Creator continues to this day. Although a proposal was later made to elevate the Church of the Creator to the Empire’s state religion, the then emperor did not express a high level of enthusiasm for the proposal, nor did the High Priest of the Church provide his explicit consent, effectively killing the proposal in its tracks.

	<h4>"Maja"</h4>
	<strong>Unlock at Lv10</strong>
	<br /><br />
	Maja Reston, the father of the restored Church, and the current High Priest of the Church of the Creator, Maja Shaan, share the name “Maja” but they are, in fact, not related by blood. Interestingly, there are several additional important figures from the Church’s history who also share the name “Maja”.<br /><br />One of whom is Maja Tuttle, who famously established a system of rules for the religion’s adherents in ancient times.<br />Another is Maja Demus, who supported his fellow believers during the reign of the God of Ruin.<br />Yet another is Maja Tau, who was involved in Aldana’s transition to imperial power.<br /><br />Those not privy to the internal customs of the Church are likely to think it strange that so many people bearing the name “Maja” have made such a significant mark on the Church and its history. However, it is in fact common practice in the Church to receive the name of a prestigious saint and give it to one’s children, so it is hardly unusual that many individuals bearing the name “Maja” appear throughout the Church’s history.<br />Even now, there are several people involved in the Church who bear the name “Maja” other than the current High Priest.<br /><br />The first Maja to appear in the historical record was a person who served most closely by the Creator’s side during the mythical age. That person is believed to have established the proto-organization which would later become the Church. The “Maja” in the Great Temple Maja, which serves as the headquarters and primary base of operations of the Church of the Creator, is derived from the above historical figure. Said figure did not himself create anything that might be regarded as commandments or teachings. Yet he left behind to posterity various sayings which are believed to have been bestowed to him by the Creator.<br /><br />It is worth noting that the current High Priest of the Church of the Creator, Maja Shaan, is also a member of the Imperial Council, sometimes referred to as the “Council of Ten”. He is also heavily involved in imperial affairs, and many expect his power to contribute to the further development of the Church.
