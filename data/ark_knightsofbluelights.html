	<h4>The Azure Knight</h4>
	<strong>Unlock at Lv2</strong>
	<br /><br />
	In the olden Lanzelian kingdom, there was a circle of knights that shook the surrounding lands and monsters with their ferocity.<br />They were known as the Knights of Blue Lights.<br /><br />It's said that the continent of Lanzelia was a barren land covered in ice for the better part of the year, so it hardly ever came under attack by invading forces.<br />However, it's fair to say that the Beasts, bandits, and pirates running rampant were already a considerable risk to the people living there. Although the situation had improved slightly after the start of the kingdom, there were still many undeveloped lands, and it was difficult to spread their settlements. Therefore, a royal knight named Alvis proposed the launch of a combat unit to destroy the Beasts.<br />Enter the Knights of Blue Lights.<br /><br />Alvis gained the king's approval and proceeded to select people. Of course, a certain level of fighting prowess was required, but people with necessary skills in poisons and gunpowder were also brought in. Their fight would be against Beasts rather than humans, so those who could only fight in war were not fit for the mission.<br />Alvis, who organized the battle array, charged through Lanzelia with his subordinates. At the time, it was assumed that the knights were assembled to fight in international wars for the king, rather than to fight for the people. Therefore, the Knights of Blue Lights received a lot of scorn from other knights living in the royal capital.<br />However, the knights continued their battle with ferocious Beasts and bandits, and over the course of successive conquests, their popularity increased among the people. Gradually, those who looked down on them became few and far between.

	<h4>The Knight Commander's Scheme</h4>
	<strong>Unlock at Lv4</strong>

	The Knights of Blue Lights fought one particularly intense battle in Talon Tundra. At that time, there was a bandit group that had been ravaging the southern part of Lanzelia.<br />They took in Beasts like gaouls and hobgoblins – even though they make for a rare sort of thief – and these brigands were so strong that they were not easily subjugated by town guards.<br />They were able to slip past stronger opponents as they did not keep a specific hideout, and were always working on the move. So even if authorities were able to catch one member at a time, dealing a devastating blow to the group as a whole was impossible.<br /><br />Alvis came up with a plan.<br />He spread a rumor that a merchant carrying a gift to the royal family and the merchant union would be crossing Talon Tundra.<br />Afterward, the knights lay in wait for the bandits to come steal the rumored wares.<br />The plan was a success: by the time the bandits realized they had been duped, the knights had them in a trap that even an ant couldn’t have slipped through.<br />The bandits had no intention of being caught, and so lashed out with desperation against the knights that came in to defeat them. But the outcome was obvious from the start, and the knights succeeded in destroying the bandits, though they suffered some casualties from the Beasts.<br /><br />They say that this battle spread the Knights of the Blue Lights’ name to not only southern Lanzelia, but all over the continent.

	<h4>The Evria Battlefront Miracle</h4>
	<strong>Unlock at Lv7</strong>
	<br /><br />
	Though the Knights of Blue Lights were established to maintain the peace of the realm by vanquishing bandits and Beasts, they were also part of the royal guard, battling foreign enemies. <br />Around the time when Oswell, the third leader of the knights, took office, the Holy Odal Kingdom and Lanzelia entered into battle.<br />The Knights of Blue Lights were to be sent out to sea from Port Granada to respond to the invading army coming in from the south. The higher ranking Lanzelians planned to come in for the kill once the Odal army was exhausted; unleashing a scorched-earth tactic upon them.<br />The Knights of Blue Lights were responsible for the removal of goods and the evacuation of citizens in the area. <br />However, Oswell looked at the Odal army formations on the Evrian Plain and saw weaknesses clear as day. He completely changed the approach and went in for a drastic and decisive attack on that snowy night.<br /><br />The Odal army was ripped apart. They were aware of Lanzelia’s scorched-earth operation, but thought they wouldn’t be set upon by enemies until they actually marched in to attack them.<br />Although the Odal forces had superior numbers, their army crumbled under the surprise attack without a means to retaliate.<br />They were forced to withdraw completely from southern Lanzelia.<br />This battle was called “The Nightmare of Evria” in the Holy Odal Kingdom, and the “Evrian Front Miracle” in Lanzelia, and has long been passed down in stories.<br />As a result of this distinguished war effort, the Knights of Blue Lights came to be known not for their simple national guard work, but as the most elite unit in Lanzelia, and they continued working until the kingdom was overthrown by the Aldana Empire.

	<h4>The Mystery of the Knight Commander</h4>
	<strong>Unlock at Lv10</strong>
	<br /><br />
	Alvis, the creator and first leader of the Knights of Blue Lights, was a person with many mysterious quirks.<br />The Lanzelian knight class was mostly made up of well-to-do people that were born there. However, it is not clear where Alvis was born, and it’s theorized that he came from somewhere else – unusual among Lanzelian knights.<br />Furthermore, even on top of the uncertainty of his pedigree, the fact that he and the King of Lanzelia were as thick as thieves is another mystery. One theory posits that the king was attacked by an assassin during a tour of Lanzelia and Alvis saved him, which is what tied them together and why Alvis came to serve the kingdom. However ,nothing to support this theory has been found.<br /><br />Clayden, who worked as a lieutenant under Alvis and became the second leader of the circle of knights, said of him later:<br />“He was a mysterious person.<br />He had a surprising amount of combat knowledge, but he was often ignorant of the culture of Lanzelia, and we had to correct his mistakes. However, even though he didn’t have any knowledge of the land of Lanzelia itself, he seemed to be very used to doing things and fighting battles in the cold region.<br />Once I asked him about his hometown, and he just laughed and said, ‘It’s a very faraway place.’”<br /><br />Even now, it is not clear where Alvis was born and who he really was. However, it is an undeniable fact that he had an abundance of experience in fighting Beasts, and above all else, that he fought for the people of Lanzelia.
