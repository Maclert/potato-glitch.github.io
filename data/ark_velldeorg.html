	<h4>Riddle of the Ruins</h4>
	<strong>Unlock at Lv2</strong>
	<br /><br />
	Legend has it that Granzelia once had a citilization that was far more advanced than we could imagine today.<br />And it’s no mere fairy tale; there are reports of ruins and artifacts that could provide clues to this ancient civilization coming in all the time.<br /><br />Long ago, back when excavations were happening everywhere, rumors started to spread about a treasure of immense value sleeping in one of those ruins. And so, a lone treasure hunter entered the mysterious ruins, determined to discover the truth.<br />This treasure hunter was a notorious dual-wielding swordswoman who traveled from ruin to ruin in search of lost fortunes. She’d ask all the townspeople she met for information about treasure, making a few acquaintances along the way. One of them said this of her as she traveled to another mysterious ruin:<br /><br />“She’s such a cheerful little dearie that you’d never think she spends all her time in dark, lonely ruins.<br />Oh, what a lovely smile she had. At least, until she came back from that one trip.<br />Before she left, she was laughing about the haul she was sure to bring back this time. But she’s had a cloud over her ever since she got back.<br />She said she had to give up the ruin business.<br />It was a real downer from someone who was always looking forward to the next hunt.<br />She’s practically a different person from the adventure-loving gal I knew.”<br /><br />Modern research has put forth the theory that her sudden change was caused by an encounter with the ancient ruin known as “Vell=De=Org”.<br />What is Vell=de=Org?<br />And what happened to that woman in those ruins?<br />The answers lie in the recently discovered pages of this swordswoman’s diary…

	Everyone says I changed since I came back, but this is actually the real me.<br />I was just hiding my true self. My smile was only for show.<br /><br />The reason I started treasure hunting in ancient ruins was for revenge. Because my life was in shambles after what happened.<br />I thought I’d get back at those guys excavating the ruins by stealing that which they coveted most.<br /><br />But… my thoughts started to change after one of my trips. Or, I suppose it would be more appropriate to say that I discovered a better way to really get my revenge.<br />The place I went then – that ruin – it has its own will…<br />Vell=de=Org asked me to help it.<br /><br />It said to me, “Ancient ruins are not meant to be ravaged by people. I know you to be someone who can protect hidden treasures in ruins from those with ugly intentions.<br />Those who support them are fools.”<br />To be honest, I wasn’t sure what it meant at first, but as I listened to its story, I slowly began to grasp what had happened.<br /><br />I have felt so ashamed of my previous way of thinking ever since. And then I started thinking that maybe this is what I should’ve been getting revenge for in the first place.<br />I mean, I’ve lost so many people who were dear to me because of the conflicts involving the ruins and their treasures.<br />Up until now, I was putting the blame entirely on the treasure, but now I think that way of thinking was wrong. The real fault here is with those who want to use the ruins and treasures for evil purposes.<br /><br />We must protect the ruins until the time comes when they become truly necessary. And when it does, my heart will feel full.<br />Vell=de=Org promised me that.<br />Filled with what, I don’t know. I just know I’ll find an answer once I’ve fulfilled my duty.<br />I truly believe that.

	<h4>Struggle at the Ruins</h4>

	From the swordswoman’s diary, we understand that the ancient ruins collectively known as Vell=de=Org possessed their own will. And moreover, the ruins had apparently entrusted their will to people. <br />We do not know anything more beyond what was written in the diary however. All we know is that after going into the ruins by chance, the swordswoman went on to fight numerous thieves in order to protect it.<br /><br />These records were confirmed in the memorandum of a prince whom the swordswoman claimed was her beloved. According to his record, many came to the ruins, but she stopped them all from entering. In particular, the swordswoman and a thief who was infamous at the time were often at odds, frequently clashing over the treasures of the ruins.<br /><br />She was loath to dirty the ruins’ walls, so she would frequently launch her defensive strikes outside.<br /><br />Many theories try to explain this particular behavior. Some say she was a neat freak. Others say it was because uncleanliness would lessen the powers of the ruins or perhaps even cause them to spiral out of control.<br />As Vell=de=Org’s guardian, the swordswoman admirably repelled the intruders one after the other.  However, her enemies’ numbers only grew each time.<br /><br />In the years leading up to this, Vell=de=Org had been researching some kind of special magical power to bestow upon the swordswoman, but she had only one body, and even that sort of aid would have had a limit in its effectiveness. On one occasion, the thieves ganged up on her and had her cornered. The ancient ruins were in danger. But then the prince the swordswoman claimed to have loved appeared to save her in the nick of time.<br /><br />The swordswoman may have been under Vell=de=Org’s protection, but she must have been lonely.<br />(We will set aside her alleged relationship with the prince due to a lack of evidence.)<br />Her loneliness likely stemmed from the fact that she understood her duty, but had no one to share her burden with, and also because she had sought out no allies.<br /><br />Was there some kind of change in her due to her contact with the thieves and the prince?<br />This could only be known if one were to go back in time and ask her. But there exist records of her teaming up with the prince to take care of the thieves they subdued after their initial fight together.<br />(Although the prince’s records weren’t the most reliable in terms of accuracy about the details of such events.)<br />At any rate, the swordswoman who protected Vell=de=Org most definitely had a change of heart, although it was slight.

	<h4>Ruins' Purpose</h4>
	<strong>Unlock at Lv10</strong>
	<br /><br />
	Vell=de=Org's request left the swordswoman in solitude.<br />Naturally, she made decisions of her own free will and she would not allow the ancient ruins to intervene.<br />However, it is believed that Vell=de=Org's request and power were strong enough that they did exert some influence on her decisions.<br />The swordswoman's ideals never wavered from Vell=de=Org's as she continued to protect it.<br />But the prince's scrupulous memorandum about the swordswoman came to an abrupt end, and her whereabouts became unknown. <br /><br />There is still a lot we don't know about Vell=de=Org.<br />Despite knowing of its existence and having a few records about it, we still don't know Vell=de=Org's precise location, how it came to be sentient, or the true nature of its magic.<br />Therefore, the following information I'm about to tell you about the ancient ruins is merely conjecture presented by a scholar in recent times.<br /><br />According to this theory, Vell=de=Org has survived until today after having taken upon itself a continuous link to the will of an ancient civilization that was going to ruin.<br />It would have been difficult for the ancient ruins to maintain that will on its own, so in order to survive, it had to make a contract with a human.<br />We can assume it had chosen the swordswoman.<br /><br />We can also assume then that the swordswoman was only one such human with whom Vell=de=Org has made a contract.<br />We believe there were multiple people before and after her with whom Vell=de=Org made contracts to continue carrying out its will.<br /><br />However, we cannot verify the legitimacy of this theory at this time; we do not know if there is someone currently protecting the ruins under contract with Vell=de=Org.<br />Nor can we be sure if the swordswoman's successor was successful at protecting the ruins or not. Could the theory be wrong, then?<br /><br />Yet another scholar offers the following defense:<br /><br />"It's true that the will of the ancient ruins gets handed down.<br />However, that succession has been delayed for reasons unknown."<br /><br />Why is the succession at a standstill?<br />One scholar claims it is because Vell=de=Org's will has been sealed away by a research institute somewhere in Granzelia.<br />This institute prides itself in having the best technical prowess in the world and is said to be experimenting on the will of the ruins to try to unlock the secrets of its magic.<br />If this is true, then more information about the mysterious ancient civilization should be revealed before long.<br /><br />But is sealing the will of an ancient ruin actually permissible?<br />Some have voiced their concern that this may provoke the wrath of an ancient civilization we know nothing about.<br />Curiosity and fear are at war on this matter.
