	<h4>Weed Warrior</h4>
	<strong>Unlock at Lv2</strong>
	<br /><br />
	Long ago, when the Mordana Kingdom was thriving, it was home to a female warrior named Sera.<br />She was born to a family who, by the standards of the aristocracy in which she lived, was of low social standing.<br /><br />At the time, the kingdom was subservient to the God of Ruin, though this did little to protect the citizens from the god’s wrath.<br />Sera herself lost her family during her youth to violence enacted by the god’s followers. She nearly lost her life as well, but a lone swordsman appeared at the last minute to slay the god’s followers and save her life.<br /><br />From then on, the swordsman took Sera as an apprentice and taught her all he knew. She listened well to her teacher and grew into an adept swordswoman in the blink of an eye.<br />Sera and her teacher took every opportunity to sharpen their skills, even by slaying dragons that terrorized the people. Dragon-slaying was a top priority for the kingdom’s army, so the state would normally have valued such accomplishments. However, the nobility viewed them as mere grunts, with the state hardly treating them any better.<br /><br />Sera left behind two legends from her days of exterminating dragons.<br />The first is that she once took on five towering dragons at once and felled them with ease. Sera set her sights on one dragon and concentrated every attack on the Beast until it was defeated. She then used that dragon’s corpse as a shield to protect herself as she defeated the remaining four.<br />She once said this about that battle:<br /><br />“You have to use your head. No amount of training will give you the muscle of a dragon. You have to accept what you can’t do. Only then can you make a plan to beat your opponent.<br />That’s how I’ve always fought.”<br /><br />Her other legend concerns her battle against a giant red dragon…

	<h4>Terror of the Dragon's Treasure</h4>
	<strong>Unlock at Lv4</strong>
	<br /><br />
	On Sera’s first day as a dragon-slayer, a giant red dragon appeared in the kingdom’s mountains and began attacking people. The nobility sent in royal knights, but they soon broke contact and disappeared.<br /><br />Deeply concerned, the nobility needed to investigate, so they contacted well-regarded warriors – Sera and her master – and tasked them with scouting the area and rescuing the knights. This was the first recorded moment where her talents were recognized by the state.<br /><br />Sera and her master traveled to the mountains to find the knights turned to stone, frozen in all manners of horrific anguish. The two continued past the petrified soldiers to find a gigantic red dragon.<br />They challenged the dragon to a battle, but were quickly defeated by its overwhelming power.<br /><br />The dragon held a jewel in its mouth that allowed it to breathe flame that turned beings to stone, making it clear that the dragon was behind the knights’ unfortunate end. Sera nearly shared their fate, but was once again saved in the nick of time by her master, who was tragically petrified in her stead.<br />She attempted to save him, but before the petrification completed, he shouted one thing:<br /><br />“You can’t win as you are!<br />Accept your weakness!<br />Flee now and train!”<br /><br />Her master’s words made her realize how powerless she was as she ran away from the dragon. If she ever wanted to defeat it, the first step was to endure this shame and escape.

	<h4>Fairy of the Lake</h4>
	<strong>Unlock at Lv7</strong>
	<br /><br />
	The first obstacle to defeating the giant red dragon was overcoming its petrifying flames. As such, Sera searched for ways to counter dragons while polishing her technique. Her search led her to rumors of a fairy that lived in a lake in this very kingdom.<br /><br />Receiving the fairy’s blessing would bestow one with the ability to withstand powerful magic, but finding the lake itself would be a massive effort, so Sera asked the remaining royal knights to conduct a search.<br />Sadly, the kingdom was far too disappointed in Sera’s defeat to hear her pleas.<br /><br />“We have far more pressing concerns than listening to the whims of a would-be warrior who’d leave her master for dead.”<br /><br />The kingdom was set on challenging the dragon again with no heed paid to Sera’s advice, so she set out to find the lake alone.<br /><br />Her journey was no leisurely stroll. She climbed steep mountains, leapt from cliff to cliff over chasms hundreds of feet deep, and fended off attacks from monstrous boars before reaching the lake. It was there that she finally found the fairy.<br /><br />The fairy understood Sera’s predicament before she could say a word.<br />Sera learned that the tribulations she overcame to find the lake were part of a test arranged by the fairy to determine if she could truly slay the dragon.<br />Having proven herself worthy, Sera was given a stone that could withstand the dragon’s breath.

	<h4>Demise of the Dragon's Treasure</h4>
	<strong>Unlock at Lv10</strong>
	<br /><br />
	The fairy explained that the jewel in the giant red dragon’s mouth had to be sealed to free its victims from the curse of petrification.<br />And the power to nullify that jewel’s effects while petrifying the dragon in return lay in the stone Sera had just received.<br />Sera’s own training would be essential to drawing out the stone’s true potential, so she continued her training as she ventured back to the mountain that dragon called home.<br /><br />Thereafter, she returned to the dragon’s domain and challenged it once more. Her improved swordsmanship allowed her to fight with the dragon on nearly equal footing – until exhaustion set in.<br />It was then that she failed to fully evade one of its breaths, causing her leg to become petrified.<br />Sera had no choice but to bind the stone to her blade and use the last of her strength to cast it at the dragon.<br /><br />The sword pierced deep into the dragon’s jewel, immediately turning the dragon to stone.<br />Then, the fairy’s stone and the jewel both shattered in unison.<br />In return, Sera’s leg, the Royal Knights, and Sera’s master were all returned to normal.<br /><br />Sera returned from the battle with her head held high.<br />The kingdom lauded her achievement and granted her knighthood, after which she continued to serve her country.<br />The dragon, however, was by no means gone forever.<br />It is still out there, slumbering in its stony prison.<br />When it will awaken, nobody can say.
