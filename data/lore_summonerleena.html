	The chosen maiden for the healing powers of Yggdrasil.<br />Leena was a meek young girl from the island of Migal. Known as the Maiden of Yggdrasil, she has left a small legacy of being able to heal any wound as well as having the power to communicate with any beast.<br /><br />One day, she received a royal invitation from the king of the Holy Kingdom. He had grown curious of her power and sent for her. Confused and a little overwhelmed, Leena was still unaware of her influence and fame throughout the lands.<br /><br />“His Majesty is asking for me? It must be… some sort of mistake…”<br /><br />Of course, this invitation was no mistake, and Leena was in no position to refuse the official invitation of the king. After a week, she had set out, crossing the ocean and making her way across the continent to the Holy Castle.<br /><br />As the first time off of Migal Island, she was uncomfortable with the idea of traveling the land on her own. However, with time, she began to enjoy the adventure and everything that came with it.<br /><br />“I didn’t want to travel alone… but there’s a lot you can do! New friends to make, new sights to see. New towns I would’ve never even heard of if I never left the island.”<br /><br />She continued her journey to the King’s castle while helping people as she went. Soon enough, she arrived at the rainforest, the halfway point in her trip. It was then, she heard the voice of Yggdrasil echo in her head.<br /><br />“Leena, my child. Here, where thou stands, the earth’s energy is unbalanced. As my chosen one, it is your duty to return it to its original state.”

	<h4>Earthly Disturbance</h4>

	Hearing that voice, Leena decided to help whatever was going on in this rainforest. She went about, talking with the Gaouls and Gobls on the outskirts of the tropical woods.<br />According to them, a terrifying beast that took on a twisted form of a spider made its home in a shrine within the rainforest and since then, small earthquakes would disturb their normally peaceful days.<br />She pondered upon the thought of the shrine having to do with the magic that naturally flowed through the earth, and decided to head to the said shrine immediately.<br /><br />The further she went, the more cobwebs and half-consumed carcasses of other beasts became more frequent amongst the natural vegetation. She shook her head, clearing out any thoughts of what was physically around her, and focused her magic on the very ground she walked upon. Upon doing so, Leena noticed a particular force, festering, just out of sight.<br /><br />“There it is…”<br /><br />She began to take a step forward, determined to return the shrine to its former state, but the ground shook. Gradually, the shaking became worse. It was too glaring to be considered a small earthquake like the beasts on the outskirts of the rainforest described, but she had lost track of how far into the rainforest she had gone. She made herself small near a sturdy tree, hoping to wait until the tremors stopped.<br /><br />Looking up for a moment, she saw a large spider beast cross the path she was just on. Each step it took was enough to cause the earthquakes. Leena caught a glimpse of its face. The mouthparts were large and sharp, as if their fangs were replaced by blades. Eyes that seemed like they could glow in the dimmed light of the rainforest. She held her breath as it paused before heading to the shrine, its nest.<br /><br />Once it was further away and the ground had stopped shaking, she let herself relax.<br /><br />“That must’ve been the spider beast everyone was talking about…”<br /><br />Leena was always in touch with beastkind, getting along with them easily. But there were always times when she had to defend her fellow humans from the ones that wanted to cause harm. Because of this, she was always able to keep herself level-headed and make rational decisions. Despite her past experiences, she felt uneasy.<br /><br />“I know that beast is responsible for all of this… but what do I do?”<br /><br />Leena had left her friends behind for this journey, and she specialized in support. Even at her fullest, she knew she wouldn’t be able to take on the terrifying spider beast on her own.<br /><br />Yggdrasil had chosen then to reach out to her.<br />“There is another shrine, south of where you are now. Melisus is there. They will offer their help.”<br /><br />And true to Yggdrasil’s words, as Leena headed south, she came across a shrine covered in the local greenery. The arch that served as an entrance was made of a solid stone that didn’t crumble despite the tremors. In fact, this shrine itself was void of the cobwebs and corpses the other was covered in.<br />There were heavy stone doors as well. But before she could reach out to push on them, they opened on their own. Inside, a staff floated in place, illuminating the interior of the shrine.<br /><br />“Is this… Melisus?”

	Leena carefully held Melisus in her anxious hands. Upon holding it, she felt two distinct presences nearby. Turning to where she thought they were, her voice echoed through the shrine:<br /><br />“Who’s there?”<br /><br />She looked from side to side, trying to locate the two that were in the shrine with her. She could tell they were in the same space, and that they weren’t hostile to her. <br />A warm welcome, the soft embrace of a familiar friend, or the safety of a mother protecting her young; Leena focused on emanating those feelings and gradually, two figures came into the light.<br />A noble wolf and what looked like a boulder covered in moss.<br /><br />“You’re…”<br /><br />She began, but the staff let out a blinding light. And with that blinding light, came the knowledge to use Melisus’ power – how to summon the two before her, and how to amplify the power they already possessed. As the light died back down to its former glow, Leena came to understand what she had to do.<br /><br />The wolf spirit was the Spirit of Wolves, Szasz.<br />The moss-covered statue was the Jade Sprite of Nature, Bardas.<br /><br />Both were summoned beasts of Melisus’s wielder.<br />Szasz approached Leena, rubbing its face against her side. Bardas fumbled over with an equally clumsy but wholehearted greeting.<br /><br />“Hehe… Thank you for deciding to help me.”<br /><br />Bolstered by powerful allies, Leena felt confident enough to return to the corpse and web-covered shrine. However, the terrifying creature was nowhere near the entrance of the shrine.<br />Soon after she set foot into the darkened sanctuary, an ear-splitting and inhuman shriek broke the silence.<br />That thing was lurking deep within.<br /><br />Leena reassured herself that her newfound friends would give her the power to defeat it. She took another step forward, and another, and another. There were perhaps a hundred smaller spiders that looked similar to the beastly one from before – its children. They attacked her all at once, but not once did Bardas let the arachnids reach Leena, swatting them down as Szasz tore through the bugs with their fangs.<br />Steadying her breath, Leena unleashed her power through Melisus. The cane amplified her magic and the smaller beast spiders were reduced to twitching corpses, similar to the ones outside the shrine but on a much smaller scale.<br /><br />Leena beamed at her new friends, as she held Bardas’ arm with one hand and petted Szasz with the other.<br />“We can beat anything that comes our way now! Let’s go, Szasz, Bardas!”

	Going further into the shrine, she was finally able to gather her thoughts to go against the fearsome spider beast, Dilsanis. Soon enough, Leena was face to face with it. it was much larger, taking up so much space within the cramped shrine. <br />Still, she did not turn and run. With newfound companions Szasz and Bardas, Leena knew she could defeat the spider beast that was responsible for terrifying all the other beasts of the Badal Rainforest.<br /><br />“Skreeeee!!”<br /><br />The oversized spider screeched at the pigtailed maiden, its sharp fangs aiming for her petite form. Bardas’ stone arm blocked the blow while Szasz leaped forward to the spider’s torso with their own fangs. Dilsanis let out another noise, trapping the two with the mucus-like webbing as it flailed in pain. Szasz and Bardas couldn’t move, but Leena did not panic. With Melisus in hand, she let her magic flow out through it.<br /><br />“It’ll be okay… Allez Floria!”<br /><br />Melisus emitted another bright light, and the sticky webbing came off her companions. The light itself also damaged the spider beast. Taking this opening, Sasz and Bardas let out their attacks. The enemy let out another screech as it was defeated, and the tremors stopped at once. Now the forest could return to normal with the spider beast as a thing of the past. A nightmare that would not revisit them.
