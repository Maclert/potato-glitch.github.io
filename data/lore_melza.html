	<h4>Kindhearted Knight</h4>
	<strong>Unlock at Lv10</strong>
	<br /><br />
	This is the tale of a daughter belonging to the aristocracy of the Kingdom of Mordana who also served as a knight of the realm. Her name signified her parent's hope that she might challenge the God of Ruin and the tyranny for which he was responsible.<br /><br />Melza's name first appeared in the kingdom's historical record at the tender age of 14, when she accompanied a desert patrol on a mission to subjugate a group of beasts which was led by the king.<br />According to local historians, her father should have served in battle rather than the girl herself, but he was sickly by nature and his daughter fought in his stead.<br />During the mission, it was Melza who saved the king's regiment as they were ambushed by beasts after having been cut off from the rest of the expedition by a sandstorm. She succeeded in repelling the beasts.<br /><br />While he was somewhat taken aback when he heard that the person responsible for saving his regiment was none other than a young girl barely of age, the king was nevertheless impressed by her courage and mettle. The king is said to have raised the feudal rank of Melza's clan as a sign of his gratitude and as an affirmation of Melza's bravery and exceptional ability.<br /><br />Melza is said to have been liked by many people because she seldom put on airs and never attempted to separate herself from the common citizenry. She had a gentle personality, and sometimes struggled to express her true feelings.<br />It is therefore difficult to ascertain her character in precise terms, but it is clear from her actions that she had a strong sense of right and wrong and was kind at heart.<br /><br />While all of Granzelia buckled under the tyrannical rule of the God of Ruin, Melza is said to have provided as much relief as she could to those who were suffering.<br />However, the cold, hard reality was that Melza's options were limited as the Kingdom of Mordana joined its neighbors in submitting to the God of Ruin.<br /><br />During that dark time, a village with whom Melza had been on friendly terms was being systematically extorted by the God of Ruin and the god's underlings threatened the village with destruction if their demands were not met.<br />Melza tried to save the village by making every effort to meet the God of Ruin's demands. However, her efforts were in vain, and the village was violently extinguished at the hands of the beasts.<br /><br />It was this incident that planted in the young girl's heart the seeds of determination which would later germinate in spectacular fashion.

	<h4>A Swordsman of Flame</h4>

	Records show that after the destruction of a village that was dear to Melza's heart, the girl suddenly disappeared from the Kingdom of Mordana.<br />It is now known that she left on a journey hoping to eventually liberate the world from the unreasonable tyranny installed by the God of Ruin. However, at the time, no one understood Melza's purpose in disappearing and many who lived in the village of her birth and the surrounding area were greatly disturbed.<br /><br />Melza's whereabouts remained unknown for a while thereafter, but rumors circulated that she was on some sort of journey and traces of the girl's presence can be found in certain regional records of the time.<br />Among them is an account of the girl's chance meeting with a certain swordsman on the continent of Lanzelia.<br />The precise details of how it happened remains a mystery to this day, but the swordsman apparently started to follow Melza upon hearing that she was on a mission to liberate the world from the God of Ruin.<br />When one follows Melza's subsequent path through the historical record, it is easy to find records showing that a certain swordsman wielding a sword enchanted with the power of flames was often found by her side.<br /><br />A cursory look reveals several records of Melza and the swordsman fighting together, of which the most famous battle was perhaps the 'Battle of the Grand Wall.'<br />Said battle was prompted by a thirst for revenge on the part of certain forces within the Kingdom of Lanzelia which had once been humiliated by the swordsman, and Melza was reportedly only tagging along. As her forces were besieged by a powerful army at the Grand Wall, Melza maintained a calm demeanor, initially suggesting a compromise between the swordsman and the forces calling for his head.<br />However, her words fell on deaf ears on both sides and her council was for naught as the Grand Wall and the surrounding area succumbed to the chaos of battle.<br /><br />As the battle raged on, Melza and the swordsman became separated and Melza, now all alone, became surrounded by enemy troops.<br />Just as all seemed lost, a man stepped forward to block the progress of the advancing troops.

	<h4>Acknowledged Fellow</h4>

	The man who rushed to Melza's aid at the Grand Wall was a knight who had once been part of her retinue. He had greatly admired Melza and set out on an extended search for her after she left the kingdom without so much as a word.<br />The knight wiped out the enemy forces bearing down on Melza, wielding a powerful blade of ice. He is said to have shown overwhelming strength.<br /><br />Had the knight simply left the scene after rescuing Melza, the situation might have been resolved without incident. However, his sword turned toward the swordsman who had already been in Melza's company.<br />Apparently, the knight was under the mistaken impression that Melza had fled the kingdom at the behest of the swordsman.<br />As the knight and swordsman clashed, one wielding a sword of flame, the other a sword of ice, Melza inserted herself between the combatants in an attempt to make peace.<br /><br />"You are both my dear friends. And there is no reason that friends should fight like this!"<br /><br />The sound of the girl's voice brought the two men to their senses and they sheathed their swords for the time being. Shortly thereafter, the knight and the swordsman started to make their respective cases to Melza.<br />Melza listened carefully until both men had spoken their piece, and then carefully dispelled the knight's misunderstanding and the swordsman's bloodlust.<br /><br />Thanks to the efforts of Melza, the scene ended without incident, and the two men joined Melza's party, with the knight pledging to defend Melza at all costs as an expression of loyalty to the kingdom.<br />However, the unfortunate first impression which the men made on one another was further exacerbated by the fact that the knight and the swordsman were not of a very compatible character.<br />Even after leaving the Grand Wall, the two men seemed to be at loggerheads at every opportunity. Many of the village folk who lived in a small hamlet where Melza's party had stopped to rest viewed the relationship between the two men with suspicion with one remarking:<br />"I don't want to know what might have happened had those two met under any other circumstance."<br /><br />Melza seemed to place her trust in both men, remarking in her usual taciturn way that she was still able to "continue pursuing the objective I set out to achieve on this journey thanks to your efforts."

	<h4>The Legendary Sword</h4>
	<strong>Unlock at Lv80</strong>
	<br /><br />
	Melza and her party are reported to have traveled to various ruins around the world. The ruins were said to contain artifacts produced by an ancient civilization which had reached a level of technical achievement far above that of the age in which Melza lived.<br />It is believed that Melza and those in her company were trying to find a means to resist the God of Ruin from amongst certain artifacts left behind by an ancient civilization.<br />The group continued to gather information at various ruins and at one site in particular they learned about a legend that spoke of a weapon which had once been created to destroy the God of Ruin.<br /><br />The three headed toward the ruins spoken of in the legend. However, while in the ruins, Melza and her company were beset by several crises.<br />The ruins were rife with trap after trap, including entrances and exits that sealed hapless adventurers into rooms from which there was no escape: poisonous fumes, quicksand capable of swallowing an entire regiment and hordes of beastly monsters.<br /><br />Every time they encountered a trap or enemy, the twin blades of the knight and the swordsman protected Melza. The knight's ice blade penetrated through treacherous earth and quicksand while the swordsman's flame sword banished the poisonous fumes.<br />Throughout it all Melza remained calm and collected, devising various ways of breaking through the traps and enemy encampments, and the company of three overcame all the challenges that beset them.<br /><br />The greatest of the challenges they faced was a giant beast which lay in wait for them in the deepest depths of the ruins. The moment the beast spotted Melza and the two men, it launched a ferocious attack, driving back the sword blows of both the knight and the swordsman, and showing a ferocity far above any enemy the party had encountered before.<br />Gradually, the knight and the swordsman were pushed back by the beast as they lost the initiative. Overwhelmed by the beast's assault, the two men began to resign themselves to an inevitable defeat.<br />Melza, however, never gave up. Sword in hand, she urged the knight and the swordsman on.<br /><br />"We are everyone's last hope. If we give up here, we will have betrayed the faith of all those we sought to help. <br />This creature may break our swords, but it will never break our spirit. Never give up the fight!"<br /><br />The two men were moved by her voice. It was then that Melza finally sunk her blade into one of the beast's weak points which it had revealed during the course of battle. As the beast lost its will to fight, the knight and swordsman seized their opportunity to skewer the beast with their twin swords of fire and ice.<br /><br />Having thus overcome a long gauntlet of trials in the ancient ruins, Melza and the two men discovered what appeared to be a solitary sword.<br />The sword was known as the "Maurius Spirit Blade" which, in addition to the razor-sharp edge of its blade, granted the wielder the power to summon a protective entity.<br />The knight and the swordsman entrusted the sword to Melza, who had demonstrated the strongest will of the three. It is said that the moment Melza took the sword in her hand, it summoned into existence a great war machine as its blade shone.<br /><br />At the end of their expedition, the party had obtained a great source of power. Thus, with the Maurius Spirit Blade in hand, the girl and two swordsmen turned their attention toward the God of Ruin.<br />The knew that with the power they had obtained they might yet be able to defeat the God of Ruin.<br />Or at least that is what Melza and her company believed at the time.<br />Yet there were things which Melza did not know. Namely, that tragedy which awaited their party ahead. It was precisely that tragedy which would alter their fates forever...
