	<h4>A Girl Without Limits</h4>
	<strong>Unlock at Lv10</strong>
	<br /><br />
	The Head Researcher of the Imperial Aldana Arcane Institute as well as a member of Council of Ten.<br /><br />She does not seem to have close ties with anyone in either groups. Having been hand-chosen by Prince Roland to join the Council of Ten, nobody knows the circumstance of how the two met. Perhaps Roland saw Lily as useful to his plans, or perhaps it was the other way around.<br /><br />Upon entering the Imperial Arcane Institute, Lily proposed several new pieces of engineering. Although they far exceeded the level of the same technology at the time, it was too far ahead of what the researchers understood. The only person that would be able to use the equipment to their fullest potential would be the one person that could understand their mechanisms: Lily.<br /><br />Of course, some of the simpler pieces of magical technology had been accepted and has greatly advanced many studies. Because of her vast understanding of these magical instruments and various other achievements, Lily was selected as the Head Researcher of the Arcane Institute in less than six months. It was around that time Roland chose her to join the Council of Ten.<br /><br />However, despite his recommendation, many of the members objected to the idea of having such a young girl possess such a high position. The discourse continued until the predecessor of the Arcane Institute, Coppola, spoke up at a meeting of the Ten.<br /><br />“I support Lily and I do not think it is wrong that she had been selected for this position. Yes, she has only just joined us at the Arcane Institute, but I am sure that she makes a better scholar than I. In the mere six months she has been here, Lily has contributed more to the facility than I have during my entire time here.”<br /><br />Along with Roland and Coppola’s recommendations, others from the institute had voiced their praises for Lily’s contributions and hard work. Their collective voices finally convinced even the most stubborn members of the Council of Ten.<br /><br />Zekus was also a member of the Ten when Lily joined, despite his young age. There were rumors that the tactician had somehow bribed the prince into giving him the position. It seemed that the older folk weren’t too keen on letting the newer generations handle important matters.<br /><br />After being officially given a seat in the Council of Ten, Lily worked as an authority figure for the Empire in addition to being a researcher, appearing in unexpected places at the most unexpected of times. Some even gossip about how she is able to listen into any conversation that has to do with her, even when they don’t mention her name. Of course, she hardly makes an appearance within the capital as she is often sent out with various assignments, or staying inside.

	<h4>Cryptic Researcher</h4>
	<strong>Unlock at Lv30</strong>
	<br /><br />
	Even after taking her seat in the Council of Ten, Lily’s attitude towards research remained unchanged. Many still know her for her eccentric personality and behaviors, and few have seen her outside of her research or other assignments. It seemed she hardly took time off for her own personal life as well, staying long after all of the other personnel left, and arriving much earlier than they did. At one point, Lily was so immersed in her work that the need to eat or sleep had slipped from her mind for nearly a week. Worried for her health, her assistants urged her to take a break.<br /><br />In which she replied, “Ah~, eating and sleeping are necessary for optimal performance. I completely forgot, but I’ll take a suitable break when I find the opportunity. I simply can’t take my hands off of this right now.”<br />And she returned to her work. Her assistants have confirmed that she did not take a break from her research until a few days later.<br /><br />Hardly showing any expressions besides a smile, Lily’s thoughts and intentions are not always clear. Interacting with for long periods of time leaves others feeling a chill down their spine. Other times it would be a feeling of dread or fear for their lives. Even Coppola mentions that, “Talking with Lily will feel like you are talking to someone, something, that is not quite human.”<br /><br />The exception to this is when her interest is piqued by a particular object or person. One such person is Eliza, the Chief Officer of the Imperial Intelligence Agency and another member of the Council of Ten. On the surface, it only appears as though Lily enjoys teasing Eliza, purposefully provoking the fire mage during meetings for her own entertainment. It’s unclear why Lily only has this attitude towards Eliza.

	Within the Imperial organization, Lily was regarded more of a researcher than a mage. She did not participate in spellcasting when magic testing was necessary, let alone for battles. Because of this, people think she has no experience in combat. But there is one witness who vehemently claims otherwise.<br /><br />“I went with Miss Lily to an on-site survey to a small city. We were informed of the magical anomaly that resided within that caused spatial distortions. Although, the actual situation was very different. Some sort of cult had taken residence in the small city, and they were trying to revive a terrifying beast that was sealed beneath. As soon as we found out about the sealed beast, I had attempted to contact the Empire to send suitable troops.<br />But Miss Lily stopped me, saying that it wouldn’t be needed and she could use the thing for an experiment.<br />She went up to the group on her own, cheerily as usual, “I’d like to help with your delightful experiment.” Moments later, the cultists had been restrained with magic that I have never seen before. They had been slowly sacrificing the townspeople to the beast, so I didn’t feel remorse for them. They had gotten what they wanted in releasing the beast. <br />And speak of the devil, it came. Roaring and angry for being locked away for so long. It howled at Miss Lily before charging at her, swinging its arms. Miss Lily didn’t back down. She stood there, smiling at it. In mere seconds, the beast was stopped in its tracks by her magic. Then, without lifting a finger, she opened a gate. It started sucking the beast in. I’ve never seen a beast turn tail, or at least try to, until that day.<br />And in mere seconds, it had vanished into the transfer gate. She turned back to me, like nothing had happened and said, “I’ll prepare the report. Thank you for keeping me safe down here. Now let’s make our way back home!” – in the same singsong voice.<br />I couldn’t see her face when the huge beast appeared, but I bet it wouldn’t have changed from the smiling face I still see now. That unchanging grin of hers… still sends shivers down my spine.”

	<h4>The White Laboratory</h4>

	As a member of the Council of Ten, Lily often attends the meetings with other members but her relationship with them can be described as rocky or turbulent at best. She often opposes their suggestions, causing some to think she may have a vendetta against them. Unlike her teasing towards Eliza, her comments to the other members are much more curt, serious, and uninterested – giving them the cold shoulder while politely keeping peace. (Her apologies aren’t quite genuine, and only given to shut them up.)<br /><br />Of course, one member detests the attitude she gives them. Maja Shaan, a high priest from the Church of the Creator. Maja was unable to accept her half-hearted apologies and dismissive comments, especially during the council meetings. Relying solely on the gossip from the officers who overhear the meetings, their disputes have apparently lasted anywhere from seconds to nearly half an hour. The details of their arguments are often classified information, but whatever the topic, the tension between the two is obvious. Seeing how dismissive Lily is towards Maja, it’s quite clear that she doesn’t enjoy his presence.<br /><br />With her knowledge and inscrutable presence, she seems to “float” above the rest of the Council. Some say she has that leverage over the other members because of how close she is to Roland, but these rumors don’t quite hold up when observing how Lily acts. As she is not as dismissive of the prince as she is towards Maja, she does not get close or poke fun of, as she does with Eliza.<br />That said, with her high titles, there is a chance that Roland sees her as a favorite. Head Researcher of the Imperial Arcane Institute and a member of the Imperial Council (Council of Ten) are titles that are more commonly known. But coming from gossip that only a select few even heard of, they say that she is the director of a place called “The White Laboratory”.
