	<h4>Fairy Paradise</h4>
	<strong>Unlock at Lv2</strong>
	<br /><br />
	In the western part of Migal Island, at the foot of the steep mountains, is the Fairies Forest. The World Tree there towers above all else. As the name implies, fairies inhabit this forest.<br />The area is filled with magical power sent forth by the World Tree, creating a truly mysterious environment: strange trees that contain magical power, lakes with their own will, and springs overflowing with spirits of the dead.<br />It is rumored that innumerable types of fairies live in total freedom in the Fairies Forest, existing in their incomprehensible world.<br /><br />Rumors of the Fairies Forest have been around since ancient times, and so far there are countless sorcerers and Beasts that have made this forest their target.<br />However, most of them suffer from a mysterious sensation similar to dizziness on their way through the forest, and when they come back to their senses, they have returned to the forest entrance. Even so, a few people have struggled through and made contact with the fairies. But after their return, all they talk about is the beauty and splendor of the forest, saying nary a word on how to get there. They all do, however, say one thing:<br /><br />“The fairies chose me.”<br /><br />Therefore, those who make it to the Fairies Forest and return are known as chosen fairy folk.

	<h4>Testimony from a Sorcerer</h4>
	<strong>Unlock at Lv4</strong>
	<br /><br />
	A sorcerer, one of the few who made it to Fairies Forest, recalls:<br /><br />“I was on this island because I was visiting a sick friend that lives in a port town in Migal.<br />I only went to the forest out of pure curiosity. Of course, I knew about Fairies Forest when I went. It's pretty famous among sorcerers. I mean, I also heard it was unreachable. Well, I wished to go, but I wasn't really expecting anything. But as I was going through the forest after I took the first step, everything changed.<br />Hm? What changed?<br />Well, the atmosphere I guess. I can't really described it. But I felt that the spot I'd stepped into was completely different from where I had just been. I thought it was strange, but I kept moving, and small specks of light started to come into view.<br />I wondered if it was some kind of insect, but when I looked closely, I saw it was in the shape of a person.<br />That's when I finally got it. 'So this is Fairies Forest,' I said.<br />What happened there? Well, nothing really. I mean, if I knew I could've gone there, I would have gone prepared. There were some rare plants and stuff, but I had no tools to keep them freshly preserved. So, while I was checking out all the stuff around me, I ended up back in the forest I'd been in before.<br />Why could I enter their forest? I don't even know. But maybe it was because I didn't expect to get into Fairies Forest at all?"

	<h4>Neighborhood Testimony</h4>
	<strong>Unlock at Lv7</strong>
	<br /><br />
	The people who live in the village near the World Tree see fairies on very rare occasions.<br /><br />“Oh, sometimes I see tiny shining specks. It's at night when you see them most for sure. Well, they shine, so it's easiest to see them then. But it seems like children encounter them more. After all, the fairies aren't so wary of innocent children.<br />What makes the fairies appear?<br />Um, there's nothing much in particular. If you live in this village, it's something you grow up familiar with. Besides, the fairies aren't mischievous. Oh, but there are times when things will move a little bit from their places all of a sudden. If that's what you call mischief, then yeah, they might be mischievous.<br />Hm, have I been to the Fairies Forest?<br />No one from our village has ever gone. Of course that includes me. If you ask scholars who're looking for it, they'll tell you it's a dreamland, so if you ask me if I want to go, then yeah, I'd like to go.<br />Well, for us, the sorcerers that come looking for it go shopping and stay in the village, so we're more thankful for that than anything else. In that sense, part of our livelihood is probably supported by Fairies Forest.”

	<h4>The Forest Legend</h4>
	<strong>Unlock at Lv10</strong>
	<br /><br />
	It's unknown when the Fairies Forest was established. However, there is one legend about how it came to be.<br /><br />A certain god descended to earth during the age of mythology. Their purpose was to listen to the wishes of living creatures through their representatives and grant these wishes if they judged them proper.<br />While each of the creatures voiced various hopes, the fairies said they wanted a place of their own. They were powerless in the face of the oppression of mankind and Beasts, so they wanted a place where they could live safely without being persecuted.<br />The god pitied the fairies and called for a consultation with the World Tree. The World Tree was happy to take care of the fairies' troubles. Using the World Tree's power, the god created a place to protect them from the outside, encircled by a magical barrier.<br />And that place is the Fairies Forest. Because it is a legend from an era before documented history, the credibility of the story is dubious. However, one thing is for certain: for a long time now, people have recognized the Fairies Forest as a mysterious and sacred place.
