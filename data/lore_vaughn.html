	<h4>An Oath</h4>
	<strong>Unlock at Lv10</strong>
	<br /><br />
	The comrade of the White Knight who went on a quest to defeat the God of Ruin, Lougseus.<br /><br />in early childhood Vaughn was a mischief-maker of unparalleled strength. By his late teens Vaughn’s excellent swordsmanship was already renowned amongst Lanzelian warriors. Seeking to improve himself further, Vaughn fought as many rivals as he could while on a journey to train himself. Some tales of those travels became famous, such as one in which Vaughn freed Pokkles from the colossal monster who tormented them on the Lanzelian Snowfield.<br /><br />Due to all the time he spent travelling the world, Vaughn had few friends. However, he considered one man his benefactor, an experienced soldier-of-fortune who was sort of a guardian to Vaughn. That man had been an erstwhile friend of Vaughn’s late father.<br /><br />One day the soldier of fortune asked Vaughn to serve in his stead, so Vaughn – grateful for the chance to repay the kindness he’d received – ventured out into a distant region to subjugate Beasts.<br /><br />When he arrived, hordes of Beasts were rampaging throughout the land, but Vaughn quickly subdued them. Having accomplished the mission, he returned in high and proud spirits. That was when he discovered that his benefactor had been executed.<br /><br />When the benefactor learned his hometown was about to be punished for resisting the Lougseuseans, he went into battle to buy time while the villagers escaped. Outnumbered, the man was caught and executed as a heretic. It turned out that he’d sent Vaughn on the mission because he knew Vaughn would have insisted on fighting along his side.<br /><br />As powerful as Vaughn was, he would most likely have suffered the same fate if he had joined the battle. Vaughn was outraged at both the Lougseusians and his own ineptitude. And on that day he made an oath.<br /><br />“I don’t want to feel like this ever again. I’ll gain the strength to protect who I want, when I want.”<br />

	<h4>Meeting with the Light</h4>
	<strong>Unlock at Lv30</strong>
	<br /><br />
	Vaughn had a fateful encounter with a slight yet majestic young girl who was confronting a mysterious band of attackers. Though Vaughn wished to help her, for the moment he could only stop and gaze in aw. Within the blink of an eye, her elegant but deadly swordplay had devastated the assailants.<br /><br />In the moment when she stopped to catch her breath, Vaughn stepped forward and declared, “Battle me!”<br /><br />Startled by the sudden challenge from a stranger, the girl took a battle stance but relaxed it a moment later when she realized that he wasn’t hostile. Declining the duel, the girl told Vaughn that she was on a quest to save the people from the God of Ruin’s oppression and would only use her sword to protect others. The ambition of her lone crusade astonished and impressed Vaughn – and as a sign of respect, he felt obligated to stand down. Struggling to find a way out of the dilemma, an idea came to him.<br /><br />“Alright, then I’ll join you on your quest.”<br /><br />To Vaughn, the God of Ruin and its followers were the despicable enemies who murdered his benefactor. He wouldn’t hesitate to go on a journey to battle them. Besides, once the quest was over, he could ask the girl for a duel. It would fill two needs with one deed.<br /><br />Though the request threw the girl into confusion, she declined, saying that she couldn’t bear to put Vaughn in harm’s way. But this time he wasn’t willing to back down. No matter what she said, Vaughn insisted on following her. During this journey, the girl would learn many things from Vaughn and thereby discover new sides to herself. Before long, Vaughn would become one of her most indispensable allies.<br />

	<h4>Fire and Ice</h4>

	<br /><br />
	When the two visited the Grand Wall of Lanzelia during their journey, Vaughn encountered the man who would become his lifelong rival. This incident occurred when he and the girl were surrounded by the soldiers of an influential Lanzelian. It was then that a knight wielding an ice-covered sword dashed into the encirclement at the speed of wind.<br /><br />“Who are you…?”<br /><br />Vaughn opened his eyes wide and gazed at the knight. It wasn’t uncommon for sudden changes to occur on the battlefield. But this time something was different. Vaughn could sense that the knight was a warrior equal to the girl and himself – and that he was hostile. The two’s eyes met, and the next moment Vaughn’s flaming blade was locked with the knight’s ice-covered sword.<br /><br />“Ngh… just as I thought!”<br /><br />From that clash Vaughn confirmed his assumption about the knight’s strength. For one moment the situation seemed to escalate from bad to worse, but those thoughts were soon overridden by the joy of battling a powerful opponent. The two weapons clanged against each other again and again. Nothing else mattered. Vaughn devoted the whole of his mind and body towards taking down the opponent before him; likewise, the knight focused only on taking down Vaughn.<br /><br />“Which move should I use next…?”<br /><br />Before Vaughn could turn his thought to action, the battle ended abruptly – not with the ringing of a bell, but rather the voice of the girl.<br /><br />“Stop, you two!”<br /><br />The girl explained to the knight that Vaughn was her comrade, and to Vaughn she explained that the knight was a hometown friend. After the girl’s intervention, the knight no longer minded Vaughn. Feeling somewhat deflated, Vaughn reluctantly sheathed his sword. Thus the battle finally ended.<br /><br />Following this, the three joined forces on a quest to defeat the God of Ruin. Although Vaughn and the knight recognized each others’ strength, the two constantly squabbled along the journey. Even during battles, the two knights would contend to be later. Some say that this was a great source of worry to the girl, who was forced to serve as mediator to the knights at odds. Interestingly enough, it is said that the competition between the two would often help them cooperate during battle.

	<h4>On Beyond Hardship</h4>
	<strong>Unlock at Lv80</strong>
	<br /><br />
	While traveling, the girl obtained a brand rumored to be capable of striking down the God of Ruin – a weapon called Spirit Blade Maurius. Armed with it, the three departed for Lougseus’s castle, but just before their arrival one of the Lords of Ruin stood in the way. His power bore down oppressively on Vaughn and the other members, none of whom had seen anything like it.<br /><br />Having come this far, Vaughn didn’t intend to back down. The three took on the General of Ruin with all their might, yet the General’s unprecedented and overwhelming power pushed the three into a defensive battle. During the battle, Vaughn realized his comrades had the same desperate expression as he did. Attempting to overcome their plight, he shouted:<br /><br />“Keep attacking! No matter what he throws at us, we’ll take him down!”<br /><br />Vaughn intended these words to invigorate both his comrades and himself. He tried to shake off his own anxiety whenever it came to mind, but that only fanned the fear – the Lord of Ruin was simply too powerful. Enraged at himself, Vaughn was forced to make a decision.<br /><br />He would keep the General of Ruin at bay while the knight and the girl escaped. He was about to mention this to his comrade but stopped before he ever got the chance. For he received a powerful glance from the knight. When their eyes met, each understood what the other was thinking. Despite being on bad terms with each other, the two knew each other better than anyone else ever would.<br /><br />They agreed that their top priority was to let the girl escape, and despite the ferocity of the battle, they each smiled. The two simultaneously told the girl that they’ll handle the Lord of Ruin, and that she needed to run. But knowing that it would be impossible for the pair to do what the trio couldn’t, the girl resolutely refused. But ultimately, she understood their determination and replied:<br /><br />“I’ll be waiting for you.”<br /><br />Hearing those words, Vaughn and the knight launched their ultimate attack at the Lord of Ruin. A whirl of flame and ice shook the air. The great force was powerful enough to blur the surroundings, and by the time it settled the girl was nowhere to be found.<br /><br />The General trembled in rage and ridiculed the foolishness of their action. Unaffected by his comments, Vaughn and the knight launched another attack at the General.<br /><br />“Seilios… the lady’s gonna be peeved if you keep her waiting.”<br />“Your input isn’t required. You will not obstruct MY way.”<br /><br />Contented to hear the usual response from the knight, Vaughn cracked a smile.<br />Immediately following that, the two let out a roar and attacked the Lord of Ruin. As their power waned, the pair could easily have despaired – but they did not. Determined to keep the promise to the girl, they coordinated as never before to push their powers to the limit. The two fought a fierce and earth-shattering battle with the Lord of Ruin. The pair’s rapid onslaught of powerful attacks pushed the foe into a corner and seemed about to overwhelm him.<br /><br />The two seized this moment of opportunity and struck him with all their force. Both Vaughn and the knight were certain that they were triumphant as victors.<br /><br />But the next moment, they were suddenly smashed onto the ground. Unable to grasp what had occurred, Vaughn turned his surprised eyes towards the knight, who responded with an equally confused expression. The two raised their heads and saw the lord approaching them with heavy footsteps. The pair attempted to stand, but pain and fatigue made it impossible to move freely.<br /><br />The Lord of Ruin approached the two immobile warriors and snatched their swords. He then spoke without a trace of emotion in his voice.<br /><br />“I never thought I would need to show you this form. For mere humans, you are extraordinary. But all things have an end. You shall die regretting that you ever defied a god.”<br /><br />The two raised their heads to defy that voice, only to see that the speaker had turned into an ominous figure. As if to mock the two warriors, the Lord of Ruin raised the swords of fire and ice, channeling immense magic power into the blades. But even faced with that overwhelming power and seemingly inevitable death, Vaughn did not admit his defeat.<br /><br />“She’s waiting for me. I’m not about to die here.”<br /><br />Sensing this as the bluff of the defeated, the Lord of Ruin lost interest in the two. But he released a deluge of frigidity and flame over them, and it transformed the terrain entirely. The lord turned his back and left in pursuit of Melza.<br /><br />The great force intensified on the land, as a pillar of flame rose into the sky and the bitter cold of ice reached into the bottom of the earth.
