	<h4>A Shrine Girl's Tale</h4>
	<strong>Unlock at Lv2</strong>
	<br /><br />
	Leena, known as the Maiden of Yggdrasil, was said to be able to connect with monsters. Her plant magic and healing songs gained her renown as a hero of the era of the great war between the God of Ruin and humanity.<br /><br />During the war, she protected Migal Island at the cost of some of her soul. As a tragic hero whose story is etched into legends, her life has left a deep impression on many. Her efforts to save all life on Granzelia, transcending the barriers of man and Beast, must never be forgotten.<br />And so, many books have been written in her memory. While many of these works accurately record Leena’s words and actions, others mix fact and fiction, exaggerate her mythology, or depict her as a saint.<br />Thus, it can be said that the vast majority of the general populace prefers to see her as a symbolic hero rather than as a hero in practice.<br /><br />Perhaps the most well-known depiction of Leena is the picture book titled “The Maiden’s Prayer”.<br />“The Maiden’s Prayer” has been read at least once by most, if not all people living in Aldana. In this picture book, Leena lives alone with her grandmother in an isolated house close to Yggdrasil, far from other children her age.<br />She is depicted as a gentle girl whose only friends are plants and animals.<br /><br />In reality, Leena lived in a village near the Fairies Forest, where she was beloved by her many neighbors and blessed with many friends.<br />Furthermore, her first journey to Yggdrasil is depicted as her being led by a horned horse known as a “unicorn”, despite no evidence suggesting such an event.

	While many books like “The Maiden’s Prayer” depict Leena in a similar light, there also a great deal of scholarly texts that seek to verify her achievements. Several Beast researchers have tried using logic to demystify how she was able to reach mutual understanding with Beasts.<br /><br />Heaps of Nature scientists have studied the traits which made her the only human in history able to communicate with Yggdrasil. They continue to publish books on their attempts at bearing another child capable of mutual understanding with the World Tree.<br /><br />There also exist novels depicting even more angles on Leena.<br />The novel “Queen of Yggdrasil” puts a new spin on her story with a premise which asks, “What if Leena was actually the conqueror of Yggdrasil?”<br />Obviously, such a story has no basis in truth; it is meant as pure, humorous fiction and is recognized as such.<br /><br />While this book found a cult following for its unique take on Leena’s story, more still criticized it for its twisted interpretation. In any case, the fact that such a book could even be published is a testament to how multifaceted Leena’s story can be, and how the memory of her persists to this day, finding home in the hearts of many.

	There are books about not just Leena, but those whose lives she impacted, including Beasts who loved her and who had formed their own settlement.<br /><br />During the war against the God of Ruin, Leena protected the encampment in Migal Island to keep the World Tree safe. The book “Beasts of the World Tree” records the efforts of the Beasts who worked under her at the time to save citizens in a nearby harbor from the God of Ruin’s forces.<br />The monsters sensed a disturbance in the harbor, and by the time they arrived, the guards under Captain Kevin had suffered crushing defeat by the God of Ruin’s army. The situation had already fallen into chaos.<br />To prevent any further civilian casualties, the Beasts struggled to fight back against the enemy. Afterward, the God of Ruin was sealed and the god’s followers retreated. It was thanks to the Beasts’ efforts that civilian casualties were kept to a minimum, even though the guards had been defeated.<br /><br />Their story was not recorded at the time, as most people were in such a state of confusion due to the invasion that they did not remember what the Beasts had done for them. However, some people did recall that the Beasts had fought to protect them, and thus the book was published later on.<br />It should go without saying that the spreading of this book helped change the populace’s perspective on Beasts.<br /><br />Unfortunately, it is unknown as to where the Beasts went after the battle. No record of where they may have resettled exists. Due to the lack of information on where, or if, they resettled, it is thought that a great majority of them perished in the battle at the harbor.

	<h4>Migal Island's Shrine Girl</h4>

	In addition to the countless books which record Leena’s existence, there are legends of her still told on Migal Island.<br /><br />As Leena disappeared immediately following her battle with the God of Ruin’s followers, many believe that she died in the conflict. However, some of her followers believe to this day that she survived.<br />According to these believers, after driving away the God of Ruin’s forces, Leena’s mission at Migal Island was complete, and thus she went north to spread harmony between humans and Beasts.<br />As described in this legend, she then went on to use her power in some northern land. Obviously, this is only a legend, as no contemporary literature supports it as fact, but the simple existence of such a tale is a testament of how deeply the people of Migal Island love Leena.<br /><br />Furthermore, songs of praise for her are sung throughout the island, from hymns to children’s folk songs. Hair ornaments based on the ones Leena often wore are apparently popular among the people of Migal Island. The island attracts many tourists, but it is difficult to find someone wearing one. As the custom is said to be particular to the islanders, it’s also challenging to determine exactly how popular they are.<br /><br />Even after all this time has passed, Leena is still loved as a hero by many.<br />Her legacy is likely to live on for generations to come through her various legends.
