	<h4>Archery Encounter</h4>
	<strong>Unlock at Lv10</strong>
	<br /><br />
	Lilah, as first princess of the Holy Kingdom of Odal, was the pride of her father and mother, the king and queen, and per tradition she was forced to accept a strict education from a very young age.<br />With almost no free time of her own, the princess was taught by a veritable army of elite tutors specializing in everything from manners and culture to basic magic and martial arts useful for self-preservation, and excelled in all her subjects.<br />Such a lifestyle affected Lilah in many ways, and she became used to only thinking about what was expected of her. Memoirs left by a head maid who served as Lilah's caretaker mention her great talents, but also expressed concern for the young girl.<br /><br />Yet it was her encounter with the art of the bow and arrow that would serve as a major turning point during young Lilah's development.<br />Initially, the princess was exposed to archery as a traditional martial art, fit for study at only a very superficial level. However, once engaged, she demonstrated a natural talent far exceeding her peers.<br />On the first day of training, she let fly a slew of arrows, all of which pierced through the exact center of the target in front of her, stunning her instructors.<br />Sometime later, Lilah reported to have spoken of how she felt at the time.<br />"It was nothing but sheer luck that allowed me to shoot through the target like that. Even so, I thought the reaction of my teacher at the time was amusing and for some reason I just got really into it."<br /><br />Thereafter, Lilah focused her energy on archery, and her skill improved at a rate since unheard of.<br />The princess eventually became unsatisfied with only training at the castle and, hearing rumors of a tribe in the forest known for its members' exceptional archery skills, she decided to pay a visit to said tribe, despite many attempts by those around her to dissuade her.<br />Though the forest tribe was inevitably surprised by the First Princess of Odal's sudden visit, they understood her unwavering desire to improve her archery skills and agreed to teach her their ways. Lilah, who now traveled outside the castle grounds frequently thanks to her new relationship with the tribe, is said to have started to gradually become more lively and outgoing in her character at that time.

	<h4>Duty of a Princess</h4>

	Lilah grew into her role as princess beautifully. She continued to refine her archery skills with intensity.<br />Yet all was not tranquil. It came to pass that the forest tribe which had taught her so much about the art of archery was attacked by a company of vicious beasts. Lilah rushed to the tribe's aid and repelled the beast invasion with nothing but her trusty bow.<br />Fortunately, no great damage had been done, but the princess had now learned that the Holy Kingdom of Odal had assigned the bulk of its soldiers to the defense of the royal capital and certain larger towns, with almost no garrison assigned to the kingdom's frontier.<br /><br />Though the princess wasted no time in entreating her father the king to reinforce the frontier guard, there simply were not enough soldiers available to guard the kingdom's entire vast territory, and the princess' petition was rejected.<br /><br />Despondent, Princess Lilah decided to take matters into her own hands and rid the frontier lands of the beasts which tormented her people. A female knight who also served as part of Lilah's personal guard tried to stop the princess when she heard of the latter's plans, but Lilah was resolute.<br /><br />"If nobody is going to take care of the problem, I'll just have to deal with it myself. Fighting for my people is my duty as First Princess."<br /><br />The female knight thought hard about how to best protect Lilah and formed a special guard regiment which reported directly to Lilah herself. She proposed leading this new regiment into battle during future campaigns to subjugate the beasts.<br />Lilah, understanding the knight's concerns about her safety, accepted her proposal. Thus, Lilah moved from battle to battle across the continent of Odal, along with her personal guard. She protected her people on the frontier and succeeded in bringing to heel scores of unruly beasts. As the only member of the royal family to fight directly for the benefit of her subjects, Lilah predictably earned strong support for her efforts among the people of Odal.<br />It is said that a celebratory parade was held in the capital of Odal every time the princess returned from one of her expeditions.<br /><br />Although her father the King of Odal initially tried to put a stop to Lilah's activities, he later had a change of heart when he saw how popular the princess had become, and opposition turned to support.<br />Some also claimed that the king intended to leverage her popularity to benefit the entire Odalian royal family.

	<h4>For War</h4>

	<br /><br />
	At last the battle between the God of Ruin and the humans and beasts was at hand. The masses of Granzelia had had just about enough of the God of Ruin and his underlings and when war finally broke out, many welcomed it.<br /><br />However, the Holy Kingdom of Odal maintained strong connections to certain agents of the God of Ruin due to the vast size of its territory relative to its contemporaries and public opinion regarding the war was divided.<br />One camp was of the view that the kingdom should pursue a policy of peaceful appeasement by submitting to the dominion of the God of Ruin.<br />The other camp was of the view that the kingdom must align itself with the other kingdoms of the world and seek to free itself from the God of Ruin's tyranny. The majority of the Odalian royal family favored appeasement of the God of Ruin and for a while it seemed that the kingdom's official policy would be determined accordingly.<br />However, Lilah was firmly opposed to the prevailing view among her relatives. She advocated fighting the God of Ruin.<br /><br />Until just a few years ago, Lilah considered herself a follower of the God of Ruin and her faith was regarded as simple common sense among Odalian royalty.<br />However, sometime later the princess began to question the wisdom of granting the God of Ruin such wide dominion and she became a fierce critic of appeasement. It is said that the princess' change of heart occurred during a chance encounter with a certain mysterious character, though the corresponding details are unknown.<br /><br />What is known is the princess wrote down the following thoughts in her personal notes at the time.<br />"I simply cannot forget the impact our conversation had on me. Up to this point I have never doubted our policy of allowing the God of Ruin to rule over the world... but now that I've really thought about it, it doesn't seem entirely right.<br />I must learn more about this world."<br /><br />Both the citizenry and the kingdom's soldiers enthusiastically supported Lilah's opposition to the God of Ruin. The king, unable to ignore the outpouring of enthusiastic support for the princess among his subjects, issued a declaration of war against the God of Ruin on behalf of the Holy Kingdom of Odal.

	As the battle between the beasts and humans and the servants of the God of Ruin raged on across every region of Granzelia, Lilah traveled around the world as a representative of the king, sometimes serving as a diplomat and other times offering her help as a warrior.<br />She was already well-known amongst the legions of the God of Ruin as a dangerous archer as well as a key target.<br /><br />It was during a visit to Aldana that Lilah encountered the mighty Divine Beast Vulgoth during a vicious attack on a frontier town. Lilah fought valiantly along with her personal guard to protect the town and eventually succeeded in driving the attackers back.<br />However, just as it appeared that the princess and her forces had earned a reprieve, a new legion belonging to the God of Ruin suddenly appeared and bore down on them. Her troops on the brink of annihilation, the princess fought desperately to protect her comrades in arms and was fatally wounded.<br />Sensing that her time was near, Lilah directed the female knight leading her personal guard, her most trusted lieutenant, to withdraw their troops.<br />She succeeded in diverting the enemy's attention long enough to let the rest of the company escape.<br /><br />Shortly thereafter, the female knight made her way back to battlefield once the rest of the company had fled to safety, but there were no signs of the enemy and she was unable to locate Lilah's remains.<br />News of Lilah's death is said to have greatly saddened the entire nation of Odal, which for a while seemed to lose its spirit.<br /><br />After ending its war with the God of Ruin, the Holy Kingdom of Odal carried out an unprecedented campaign of inhumane exploitation against the kingdom's territory of Aldana, and it is believed that the princess's death was a large contributing factor to the kingdom's change in policy.<br />The ruthless exploitation of Aldana eventually precipitated an independence movement within the territory which would ultimately lead to the founding of the Aldana Empire, and it is said that when she was still alive Princess Lilah was greatly displaced at the apparent abuse of the local citizenry by Odal.<br /><br />"I know that when it comes down to it that I am a member of Odalian royal family, which has greatly mistreated the people of this land.<br />And that is exactly why it is my duty to put a stop to it, at all costs even if it means going against my own father!"<br /><br />The above words were confirmed to have been spoken by the princess by one of her attendants, and were often thereafter repeated in whispered tones throughout Aldana.<br />Had Princess Lilah survived the battle with the God of Ruin, and worked to repair the relationship between her kingdom and Aldana, history might have played out very differently and the Empire of Aldana might never have ever come into being.
