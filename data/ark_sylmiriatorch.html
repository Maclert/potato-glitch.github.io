	<h4>The Snowy Mountain's Sacred Flame</h4>
	<strong>Unlock at Lv2</strong>
	<br /><br />
	It is said that a mysterious structure stands near the summit of the Lanzelia Mountains. On one corner of the structure is a lighthouse that contains an ever-burning, brilliant flame.<br />Supposedly, it will never go out, even if a heavy snowstorm wrecks the continent. A god allegedly resides in this flame, which is why it will never go out. At least, this is believed by those who have lived near the lighthouse since long ago.<br />This faith is as old as antiquity, and came long before the God of Ruin’s tyranny began. It seems that few believers can visit the building today. The fire is regarded as the god’s symbol, and it is said that worshipping this flame is synonymous with worshipping the god within.<br /><br />This great flame is called the Sylmiria Torch. There is not a single person who knows who built it, why, or how long it has been there. <br />Some say the lighthouse is managed by one woman in particular. However, few people seem to have seen her. Allegedly, she appears only to devotees whose belief is particularly strong and who have long dedicated themselves to their faith. <br />There are various stories surrounding this mysterious woman. <br />One claims she is a personification of the god and exists in the world in order to keep them concealed. There are also rumors that she is the only being who correctly received the god’s teachings, and that she is duty-bound to teach the truths only to those who have reached a certain level of faith.<br />In any case, the believers who remain, pay her utmost respect.

	<h4>The Power of the Sacred Flame</h4>

	Although humans are said to have worshipped the Sylmiria Torch, there are tales of other races worshipping it as well.<br />An account by a man who once worshipped this torch was discovered, and within it, a description of another race.<br />According to his record, the non-human race that worshipped the torch was covered with white hair and looked ferocious at first glance. However, he goes on to say that the race was obedient in its faith and behaved with courtesy. <br />He wrote that the people who were initially wary of these creatures came to accept them after seeing their behavior. Such a turnaround was relatively progressive for humans at the time.<br /><br />Why did this race worship this torch? One theory says that the light of the torch may have saved the race from extinction when they were assailed and severely injured by Beasts in a Lanzelian forest, but the details are unclear.<br /><br />The following story also exists:<br />Once upon a time, people living in the foothills of the Lanzelia Mountains were returning to the village after completing an errand when they were enveloped in a snowstorm and lost their way. While the villagers were trying desperately to find their way home, an avalanche began. <br />Just as it was about to sweep everyone away, a torch came flying in and shone its dazzling light right in front of everyone. By the time the brilliance subsided, the avalanche had vanished and the blizzard had stopped.<br />When the people turned to look in the direction of the torch, they saw a strange structure in the mountains, and a large, brilliant flame.<br />It is said that the light had been taken out from its kindled spot by the hand of a god, and wrapped in magical power. The villagers named it the Light of Sylmiria and worshipped it thereafter.<br />There are many such stories in addition to this one, and they introduce the light as a god that appears when people or Beasts are in crisis.

	<h4>A Lesson</h4>

	<br /><br />
	Those who worshipped the Sylmiria Torch purportedly lived according to their own customs. <br />First, it was customary for believers to accept others and overcome the walls between races. <br />It is clear that this teaching was also the reason why the white-haired race was accepted by humans at the time. In a time when people tended to fight Beasts rather than welcome them, this policy was quite unusual and not widely adhered to outside these believers.<br /><br />They also had a custom of decorating their homes with a plant that grew only in the unique climate of Lanzelia. It is said that this was done out of superstition that the plant would bring fortune from the light of the Sylmiria Torch. However, it is difficult for plants to grow in the cold climate of Lanzelia, and this plant was no exception.<br />Therefore, it was difficult to find, and taking up the challenge was said to indicate a high level of faith.<br />Also, because the plant was scarce and sold for a high price, the believers cooperated so that no one would arbitrarily pick too much of the plant; they even created an act to mandate watching over the plant’s long growth cycle in its natural habitat.<br />Besides these, the faith had a number of other customs that involved respecting nature, such as praying regularly to the mountains, and a holiday to thank the nearby rivers and the fish that fed them.<br />From this, we theorize that the believers thought not that the god of the Sylmiria Torch was one entity, but rather that it was divided into spirits for each part of nature, dwelling in mountains, rivers, and plants.

	<h4>Lanzelia Mountain Story</h4>
	<strong>Unlock at Lv10</strong>
	<br /><br />
	The origins of the faith of the Sylmiria Torch are shrouded in mystery. However, one old story is told among the people who live near the Lanzelia Mountains:<br /><br />Long ago, the land of Lanzelia was lush with nature. However, over time, people and Beasts fought in turmoil over the possession of the natural resources. The struggle continued endlessly and their battling scorched the earth that was once so bountiful.<br />It was then that Lanzelia experienced an unprecedented freeze. Only when the land was no longer habitable by living creatures, did the people and Beasts notice their foolishness, and so they regretted their savagery. At this point, a god who had heard of their regret appeared at the top of the mountain, and told them they had one chance to repent.<br /><br />The truth is that this god was the one who had cast the cold spell over Lanzelia in order to stop the incessant fighting and make the mortals pay. The god did not return Lanzelia to its original green state, but instead set a condition: if the humans and Beasts could join together to nurture the greenery they had abandoned, it would become a land upon which they could live in prosperity.<br />Then the god changed form, becoming the fire that lived within the earth.<br /><br />This is a fairy tale about Lanzelia and is therefore hard to call a historical truth. Regardless, it is deeply rooted in the hearts of the villagers as the origin story of the faith of the Sylmiria Torch.
