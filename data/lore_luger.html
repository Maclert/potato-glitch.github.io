	<h4>Soldier</h4>
	<strong>Unlock at Lv10</strong>
	<br /><br />
	A war-torn soldier wielding a cannon who was rumored to have come from another world.<br /><br />Luger learned to fight as a means of survival in a world constantly at war, and grew to be a battle-hardened veteran. When he drifted to Granzelia, the first people to meet him, feed him, and give him shelter were the followers of the God of Ruin. Such hospitality was a rarity among rarities; despite being humans like any other, people from other worlds were often treated as vermin.<br />But with the growing dissatisfaction toward the God of Ruin’s despotism, his followers coveted Luger’s skill as a soldier and hoped he could be used to fend off humanity’s rebellions.<br />The God of Ruin’s followers took advantage of Luger’s unfamiliarity with Granzelia to convince him that the God of Ruin was the one upholding law and order.<br />Luger didn’t quite take their word as truth, but with nobody providing any opposing evidence, he had no choice but to follow along. Besides, rulers in his old world had to deal with rebellion on a daily basis, so such situations were hardly a red flag.<br /><br />Eventually, war broke out between humanity and the God of Ruin. Luger fought alongside the God of Ruin’s forces and proved to be the extraordinary soldier the followers had anticipated. He proved to be particularly proficient in raids and sieges on castles or fortresses, where his beloved cannon turned their ramparts into rubble. As humanity suffered increasingly massive losses at his hands, Luger became known as the King of Destruction.<br /><br />But the more Luger fought against mankind, the more he began to doubt what he was doing. This doubt was sparked by the eyes of humanity’s soldiers. Their soldiers never let their eyes be clouded by hopelessness – not in battle, and not even in death.<br />This sort of conviction was unthinkable in Luger’s prior world.<br /><br />“Does this world treat war as something unlike anything I’ve ever experienced?”<br />Luger continued to fight as the God of Ruin had commanded, but his own thoughts grew to be something he could no longer ignore.

	<h4>The Encounter</h4>
	<strong>Unlock at Lv30</strong>
	<br /><br />
	Luger traveled to another war-torn battlefield, his doubts in tow, and found a squadron marching upon the Moriana Lands.<br />The squadron had battled the God of Ruin’s army across many nations and continents. Among them was a princess of the Holy Kingdom who fought as an archer – she was known to the God of Ruin’s army as a particularly high-priority target.<br />The squadron noticed Luger’s presence just a tad too late – they rushed to protect the princess, but Luger had instinctively took aim.<br /><br />At that moment, Luger could have pulled the trigger with no hesitation. Their haphazard formation made it clear that he’d have the upper hand if he struck first. And yet, Luger felt no desire to do so.<br />He would later say this of the event: “Why didn’t I pull the trigger? It’s been so long I don’t even remember. I’ll bet it’s just a whim. Or maybe… maybe it was because, I wanted to know more about who the enemy was supposed to be.”<br /><br />When the squadron across from him finally took a defensive position around their princess, Luger steadied his aim once more. The stress of battle washed away the feeble whim of his.<br /><br />“When a battle starts, I start shooting. Then either they fall, or I do. Nothing else to it. Same as ever.”<br />Or so Luger thought, until something unexpected cut that short.<br /><br />“Please, could all of you lay down your weapons?”<br /><br />The princess, who was supposed to allow the squadron to protect her, instead pushed them aside and stood right in front of Luger’s cannon. The barrel was nearly touching her chest, such that if he pulled the trigger, the shot would’ve surely gone through her seemingly fragile frame. Her voice cut through the worried murmurs of her own soldiers.<br /><br />“I admit it’s only a feeling… but I don’t think you have any desire to be in this war.”<br /><br />Luger was taken aback. So were the soldiers that were with her. With the slightest squeeze, Luger could have killed the princess, point blank, in front of her own people. But she stared up at Luger without a hint of fear – only determination, followed by a radiant smile after a moment.<br />Luger’s hostility vanished, and before he knew it, his hands had set his cannon on the ground.<br /><br />When the princess asked Luger why he sided with the God of Ruin, he told her his tale. Everything that had transpired since he’d drifted from his world, as well as what the followers of the God of Ruin had told him.<br />In response, the princess told him the true state of this world to counter the lies he had been fed. But of course, the truth didn’t shock Luger. On the contrary, it confirmed what he had already felt.<br /><br />“In my old world, it wasn’t rare to see people in power say whatever convenient lie let them keep that power. I used my rank as a soldier as an excuse to avoid thinking about the truth behind all of it.<br />But when I saw the eyes of the soldiers here as they never gave up hope… I knew this pathetic excuse wouldn’t cut it.”<br /><br />After that, Luger tore himself away from the God of Ruin’s army and vowed to join the side of humanity whenever he could.

	<h4>Comrade</h4>
	<strong>Unlock at Lv50</strong>
	<br /><br />
	As much as Luger wished to join humanity’s side, he found it difficult to earn their trust. Given his history with the God of Ruin everyone tended to avoid him. Seemingly aware of this, Luger traveled the land and never stayed in one place for too long.<br />However, there was one person he managed to forge a deep friendship with despite his past.<br />His name was Evan. He fought together with Luger in the Battle for the Arden Border.<br /><br />Luger obtained information that the God of Ruin’s army was coming to the border and asked how he could assist in the fight when he got there. Humanity’s forces were constantly outnumbered so they quickly borrowed Luger’s strength, but the soldiers still viewed the man they fought against for so long, as the equivalent of the enemy.<br />At first, even Evan kept his distance and rarely spoke to him. As the battle went on, humanity would fend off the God of Ruin’s forces in their fortress while a separate squad would sneak around and attack their flank. Luger was stationed to defend the fortress, but during battle, all of his comrades seemed to ignore him.<br />Unfortunately, such an uncoordinated defense could do nothing to stand against the God of Ruin’s sheer numbers, and the squad was quickly pushed into a corner.<br /><br />One soldier watching from a distance was Evan. Despite already fighting, he thought quickly before leaving his position and did something unexpected, nearly going against the very orders he was given. He rushed right into enemy lines to Luger and offered to cover his back.<br />They both guarded each other as a way to prove to the others that Luger was no longer an agent of the God of Ruin, but a fighter for humanity’s freedom.<br />Luger was surprised at Evan’s sudden plan, but he caught on quick. He let forth a flurry of fire from his cannon, not letting a single enemy come near his side.<br />The other soldiers, seeing Evan’s faith in their new comrade, also let Luger have their backs and fiercely retaliated against the God of Ruin’s army.<br /><br />“Until then, I didn’t know what it meant to trust in your comrades and to have them trust you back. I get it now… I get why soldiers in this world never give up hope even if they’re stuck in this living hell.”<br /><br />As a result, the fortress troops successfully repelled the God of Ruin’s forces thanks to Luger and Evan, while the flank troops succeeded in their planned pincer attack.<br />It was a victory for humanity.<br />Luger held a deep trust in Evan, the first man to trust him to watch his back. They would go on to fight together and achieve many more victories for mankind.

	<h4>The Return</h4>
	<strong>Unlock at Lv80</strong>
	<br /><br />
	In the end, despite great casualties, the battle between mankind and the God of Ruin ended in humanity’s favor.<br /><br />After the war, Luger helped to rebuild all around Aldana, especially the places he had previously destroyed. However, he soon heard of ruins scattered around Granzelia and left on a journey to potentially find a way back home. There were sightings of him around the world, but with no knowledge of how he arrived in our world to begin with, his whereabouts would soon disappear for good. However, a few years after Luger’s journey began, Evan received a letter from him.<br />“I think I finally found a way back to my home world,” the letter began.<br /><br />It continued as follows.<br />“I’ve always thought fighting was the height of humanity’s foolishness. I saw it as nothing more than hurting others for your own gain.<br />But then I came here… I met you, and I found a fight that meant more than that. When I return home, I bet I’ll go right back to fighting. But this time, I want to fight for something different. I want to fight for my comrades. I’ll tell them about the people in this world who I could trust. How to trust your partners. How to fight against all odds and never give up hope.<br />Thank you, my friend.”
