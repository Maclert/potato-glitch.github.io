	<h4>Swordmage Mountain: A Warrior's Hell</h4>
	<strong>Unlock at Lv2</strong>
	<br /><br />
	Mount Geist, located in the southeastern part of Lanzelia... This legendary mountain contained the Geist Training Grounds, where a great number of swordsmen gathered to pit their skills and spirits against one another.<br /><br />It is said the grounds were created by the arms dealer Gelved, who wanted a place to train mercenaries who would be dispatched to the front lines.<br />Gelved had built his fortune selling weapons to areas of conflict and wanted to start up his own mercenary group. However, his reputation as a merchant would drop if he sent out a mishmash of shoddy mercenaries. So, he decided to gather slaves and mercenaries who were indebted to him on the mountain, and forced them to endure grueling drills and training until they were decently skilled enough.<br /><br />Gelved's training on Mount Geist was cruel and inhumane, so many of his trainees lost their lives. Those who lived in the village at the foot of the mountain could often hear their screams. It was so bad that they started calling it the "Geist Devil Grounds."<br /><br />Meanwhile, some of those who survived the intense training grew to be great warriors, just as Gelved wanted. They were deployed to areas at war under the Geist Mercenary Corps banner and became renowned for their extraordinary strength all over.<br />Those who performed spectacularly were given the right to a luxurious life from Gelved. However, it could only be earned by risking one's life, and they would be barred from descending the mountain without permission. The warriors of Mount Geist were nothing more than Gelved's property, and were treated unequally.<br /><br />But the situation started changing greatly once a certain man arrived at the mountain.

	When the slave Lainesk was first brought to Mount Geist, Gelved took one look at him and said simply, "Not a chance."<br />But he gradually stood out as a swordsman, and about a year after coming to the mountain, he became known as the most employed member of the Mercenary Corps.<br /><br />Gelved was delighted with Lainesk's unexpected growth and immediately tried to give him special food and luxuries, but Lainesk politely declined it all. Gelved was suspicious of his attitude, but he allowed his important product the freedom to refuse the offer.<br /><br />Then it happened. Aiming at the moment when Gelved left the mountain for business, Lainesk rose up with those he could trust to occupy Mount Geist.<br />It was as though none of the warriors who lived on the mountain had owed their loyalty to Gelved at all. This was not the first or second revolt, but the previous ones had been on a small scale, and were suppressed by Gelved's protégé mercenaries.<br />No one had been able to win over the warriors' trust enough to start a great rebellion. Lainesk's sword skills, his personality, and his determination to seek freedom above all else had the power to bring the brutal warriors together.<br /><br />Gelved, having learned of the occupancy, hired new soldiers to march in and reclaim the mountain. However, for Lainesk, an elite warrior among the elite, such a cobbled-together force was no real threat and he crushed them with an overwhelming difference in power.<br />Gelved was taken captive. Many of the warriors on Mount Geist wanted Gelved dead, but Lainesk put a stop to that. He made Gelved promise never to return to Mount Geist, and then let him go.<br />Many were dissatisfied with this decision, but Lainesk simply replied, "There's no point in killing cowards."<br /><br />Lainesk proudly proclaimed the dissolution of the Geist Mercenary Corps and the opening of the mountain. With this declaration, half the warriors returned to their homes, but the other half remained on the mountain.<br />There were many who had been forcibly brought to the mountain and had no place to go back to. Lainesk, seeing these people who couldn't do anything but fight, thought about what they should do from then on. And so, he decided to turn the mountain into a true place to train in swordsmanship.<br />As he worked with the comrades who had stayed, to develop a system for the training center, he developed a strict self-discipline as well as training methods that were harsh and effective, but not at the cost of life. Eventually, Lainesk, the leader of the warriors, came to be called "The Sword Saint of Geist".

	Mount Geist's reputation only grew under the guidance of Lainesk, and people gathered one after another from far and wide to master the sword. Mount Geist soon came to be known not by the terrible nickname of 'Geist Devil Grounds', but as the Geist Training Grounds.<br /><br />And so, time passed, and the Sword Saint grew old. With his long absence from the battleground, his swordsmanship grew rusty, and the clarity of his youth disappeared.<br />Knowing death was upon him, he entrusted everything to his four best disciples, imploring them to lead the sword fighters of the Geist Training Grounds.<br />As a last request, Lainesk wanted a match between himself and his disciples. Worried about his physical condition, they hesitated to accept, but reconsidered it as a ceremonial battle and accepted.<br /><br />Despite their uncertainty, Lainesk showed a spirit that was s sharp as it had been in his youth. The four disciples, who now knew that their teacher was fighting them seriously, mustered their resolve and went in for the challenge.<br />But not a single one could do so much as graze the figure in front of them, and they were all soon defeated. In that moment, the disciples were reminded of the greatness of Lainesk once again. Tears flowed from their eyes; not for their defeat, but in appreciation of their fortune at receiving the teachings of their master.<br />Lainesk himself nodded, as though satisfied with the match. He held no sword after that and died peacefully a month later.

	The disciples that succeeded Lainesk chose a contingent of skilled and spirited fighters to send out across the lands in order to make their power useful to the rest of the world.<br />That was the only testament Lainesk had left them.<br /><br />Naturally, their objective was not at all similar to the old Geist Mercenary Corps' dispatching of soldiers to areas of conflict — they aimed solely to mediate wars, eradicate Beasts that harassed citizens, and to act as the nation's leading sword-fighting trainers. Any combat for self-interest was unforgivable.<br />There are even records that say Leiden, who was later hailed as a hero, came to Geist Training Grounds and began training as one of its sword fighters.<br /><br />Before long, the Geist sword fighters fought valiantly in the war against the God of Ruin to save others. They protected countless cities and villages from the divine Beasts, but by the end of the intense fighting, more than half of the sword fighters were killed or injured.<br /><br />After the end of the war with the God of Ruin, the surviving Geist sword fighters consulted each other about their future goals, though they needed no debate to establish their opinions.<br />They decided to continue working across the lands without returning to Mount Geist. They could not abandon the land ruined by war nor the people it left behind.<br />All of them were scattered across the country, with some helping the reconstruction in their homeland and others lending their power to the king, who wanted to rebuild the state.<br /><br />On the currently vacant Mount Geist, only traces of the former training grounds remain.<br />But the legend of the sword fighters who sought strength and trained together is still passed on, even today...
