	<h4>Lady of the Blaze</h4>
	<strong>Unlock at Lv5</strong>
	<br /><br />
	She is the leader of one of the units of Blaze, an organization devoted to the coexistence of beasts and humans.<br /><br />Lilebette's grandfather and both parents belonged to Blaze, too, so she was often taken to Blaze facilities as a child.<br />These many opportunities to interact with beasts built in her a cheerful disposition without prejudice.<br /><br />Once two rowdy beasts got into a fight over a minor disagreement, and a fistfight broke out in Blaze Garden.<br />People called for backup out of fear that it would get out-of-hand, but Lilebette acted without hesitation to insert herself between the two. Once she had their attention she told them,<br /><br />"You better get over this and make up with each other!"<br /><br />The two beasts got sour looks on their faces but immediately stopped fighting. One of them would later report that he felt like he was getting scolded by his mother.<br /><br />Young Lilebette was like either a daughter or younger sister to everyone in Blaze, both human and beast alike. However, since her parents were both prominent Blaze warriors and magicians they didn't have a lot of free time to spend with her.<br />There weren't many kids around her age at Blaze Garden due to the nature of the place, either, so she felt lonely at times.<br /><br />Her grandfather, who specialized in the investigation of ancient ruins, worried about her in this regard and sometimes brought her along to his workplaceâ€”that is, the sites of ruins.<br />It's not clear how much this did to offset her loneliness, but she definitely wasn't bored when she was with him, that's for sure.<br />She was delighted by the ruins and machines they discovered there, and her room was soon filled with various excavated artifacts.

	<h4>For Grandpa</h4>
	<strong>Unlock at Lv30</strong>
	<br /><br />
	Exploring ruins with her grandfather became Lilebette's favorite pastime, and she readily absorbed information about them and the machines they contained. At the same time, the more she learned the more she began to question whether it was okay to keep accompanying her grandfather on these outings.<br />The more important the ruin, the more dangerous it was.<br />Her grandfather would always make sure she was safe, but she started to realize she was an obstacle to his investigations.<br /><br />"I can't let it go on like this..."<br /><br />That's why she constructed a 'bow gun' to protect herself.<br />She hoped it would show her grandfather that he needn't let her safety hold him back from investigating the ruins. She thus expected him to be thrilled, but instead he was opposed to it.<br />He became furious, in fact, and said he would never take her into the ruins again.<br /><br />She was shocked by his sudden anger on this issue since he was never stern about anything else.<br />To prove her independence to him once and for all she ventured alone into an unexplored ruin.<br /><br />"I'm not a child anymore!"<br /><br />Her intent was commendable, but she had a rough couple of days, getting caught in traps and running into other trouble. It made her realize how strong and skilled her grandfather was... but in any case, she made it out alive on her own. She even succeeded in obtaining two small flying machines.<br />Her grandfather came running when he heard what she'd done, relieved that his beloved granddaughter was safe and sound.<br />Though he reprimanded her for going into the ruins alone, on some level he also recognized what she'd accomplished and accepted that she was capable of taking care of things on her own.

	<h4>As a Part of the Blaze</h4>
	<strong>Unlock at Lv50</strong>
	<br /><br />
	All grown-up now, Lilebette finally joined Blaze herself and began fighting as a Warrior.<br />For a while she focused on exploring ancient ruins just like her grandfather had, but in the end she chose to specialize in fighting instead. She reached this decision out of indignation over Aldana's policies to remove beasts from the empire, and also because of the many victims she saw in Blaze Garden.<br /><br />But the scope of her activity was limited to areas within Lanzelia, where Blaze Garden was located, and not any other continents. This was partly because she was deemed to still be lacking sufficient strength, but the bigger reason was that the people in charge of Blaze didn't want to involve her directly in the main fight against the empire.<br />Lilebette accepted her situation, and though she did long to be on the front lines, she focused on fulfilling the duties allotted to her one by one.<br /><br />"My mom and dad didn't start with the biggest jobs on day one. And I doubt he did either!"<br /><br />Her attitude was born from affection and respect for her parents, who had been upbeat and forward-focused as they'd traveled the world for their work... and also for a certain young man who'd once visited Blaze.<br /><br />Succeeding in mission after mission, Lilebette began to earn people's trust and was eventually put in charge of her own force.<br />And then came the day when everything changed... the turning point.

	<h4>At the Turning Point</h4>
	<strong>Unlock at Lv80</strong>
	<br /><br />
	Everything changed for Lilebette when she was put in charge of protecting a young girl with the power to change the fate of all Granzelia.<br />Though Lilebette had already accomplished a great deal, as a warrior se was still a newcomer within the organization. Thus many in Blaze were opposed to putting her in a position of such great responsibility.<br />One faction of beasts preferred the long-serving hero Dilmordo, while others said that even if not Dilmordo it should be a beast that was chosen.<br /><br />One of Blaze's fundamental principles was that humans and beasts were to be treated as equals within the organization. Nonetheless, there were still real differences between their physical abilities. And among beasts there are those who, while working towards harmony with humans, looked down on humans for their limited strength in battle.<br /><br />However, in the end the Blaze Council of Elders decided that Lilebette was suited for the job precisely because of her age. She would be of a similar age to the girl she was protecting, and could thus make better and more sensitive judgments.<br />Also playing into their decision was the forceful support from both rival candidate Dilmordo and Lilebette's grandfather.<br /><br />'I can't promise anything... but this is my first time to have such a huge opportunity so I'm going to do my best!'<br /><br />Those were her parting words to her grandfather before boarding the airship to find and protect the girl. Excitement and nervousness filled her heart as she embarked on her very first mission outside the borders of Lanzelia...
