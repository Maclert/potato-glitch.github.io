	<h4>Ferocious Subhuman</h4>
	<strong>Unlock at Lv10</strong>
	<br /><br />
	The demi-humans are a humanoid race which are generally smaller in stature compared to regular humans.<br />They are capable of understanding and even producing human speech, but their cognitive abilities are relatively underdeveloped, and what language they do produce is often halting and clumsy.<br />Though their strength varies from individual to individual, their physical prowess is roughly equivalent to humans and they can be dispatched with relative ease by a well-trained warrior in one-on-one combat.<br /><br />The demi-humans are believed to have originated in pre-historical times when they diverged from the proto-human races found in the forests and mountains.<br />They tend to act upon emotion and desire over reason. Though they are capable of wielding human-made weapons, they are almost completely incapable of repairing or manufacturing them.<br />Although demi-humans generally attack adventurers and travelers to seize their food and supplies, and are therefore regarded as somewhat malevolent, they may also interact peacefully with humans in order to sell their own goods.<br /><br />They generally make their home base in a cave, etc. and are led by an individual who serves as a kind of leader. Demi-humans are sometimes able to take organized collective action under the direction of this leader.<br /><br />As I mentioned earlier, they generally act on emotion and desire more than reason, so they are often in conflict with humans. However, there are some who are able to control their nature.<br />Groups of demi-humans led by individuals belonging to the above class generally will not attack humans and tend to live quietly in the depths of a cave or forest.

	<h4>Assigning Roles</h4>
	<strong>Unlock at Lv30</strong>
	<br /><br />
	Gobl vary from individual to individual and often exhibit a division of labor when in groups.<br />Specialized roles include guarding the entrance to the group's den, and informing the leader when something is wrong. Yet other specialists are responsible for the management of the group's loot.<br />Although their level of organization appears similar to human societies, Gobl suffer form an inability to contemplate taking action outside the purview of the role assigned to them, and are unable to conceive of flexibly performing duties other than their own.<br /><br />Moreover though, in general assigning duties requires the use of some kind of personal designation, the Gobl unfortunately do not possess individual names from birth.<br />Therefore, it is customary among the Gobl for the leader of a group to assign a name to each individual which serves to maintain order when the group acts together.<br />Therefore, a Gobl's name is not used to signify the uniqueness of the individual. When the behavior of an individual Gobl runs counter to group consensus, said individual will be stripped of its name before being cast out as a traitor.<br /><br />Gobl will sometimes also create a cohesive group unit which acts as a kind of 'regiment' in order to take collective action. Although such regiments are in no way comparable to human armies in terms of their strength, they can be controlled well by the leader when their goal is relatively simple, such as 'attack the target'. Larger teams can easily threaten and overwhelm simple defensive teams organized by human villagers.<br /><br />One account tells of how a group of human villagers encroaching on Gobl territory were attacked. And just when all seemed lost, one of the villagers who was familiar with the Gobl nature threw the food he was carrying to the Gobl. <br />Being creatures driven more by desire than reason, the Gobl were easily distracted while eating eating the food thrown to them, giving the human villagers the opportunity they needed to escape.<br /><br />Gobl can often be heard using an expression in their language which sounds a bit like “I will eat you” when attacking humans, or fighting amongst themselves. But no sightings of them eating humans or each other have been confirmed. <br />Scholars speculate that the true meaning of this famous Gobl phrase is unlikely to be “I will eat you”. There are some who think it is used as an expression of aggression or abuse.

	<h4>Bartering Route</h4>
	<strong>Unlock at Lv50</strong>
	<br /><br />
	The Gobl have their own route which they use for bartering goods, which they have stolen from humans, among themselves. When they do so, the typically cliquish Gobl exhibit a higher than usual degree of tolerance for individuals hailing from other groups.<br /><br />However, there are reportedly many cases in which both parties to a transaction are unable to come to an agreement and immediately turn to combat to resolve their differences.<br /><br />Furthermore, some Gobl understand the value of human money and will sell their wares at a great markup to humans who are unable to acquire certain goods via normal commercial routes.<br /><br />There are some particularly interesting accounts of groups of Gobl which came into possession of highly valuable items, or intelligence contraband, bringing the full might of national armies down upon them. In such cases, the Gobl are reported to have united and attacked the invading human armies.<br />However, the human troops, which possessed intelligence, physical ability, and training experience far beyond the Gobl, were able to dispatch the creatures with little effort.<br />It is said that even the violent Gobl were unable to withstand the onslaught with only some escaping by crawling away along with the goods they had stolen.

	<h4>Graffiti?</h4>
	<strong>Unlock at Lv80</strong>
	<br /><br />
	“GAAAH, GAAAH! HUMAN LIKE MAKE RECORD. GOBL WRITE STUFF TO.<br />GOBL ATTACK HUMAN BUT GOBL NOT HATE HUMAN.<br />WE LIKE HUMAN. HUMAN HAVE MANY THING. MANY THING GOBL CAN STEAL.<br />IN PAST HUMAN HAVE GREAT TREASURE. WE GOBL STEAL TREASURE.<br />TREASURE IS GREAT TREASURE. SO WE HIDE TREASURE VERY CAREFUL.<br />HIDE IN PLACE NEVER EVER FIND.<br />THEN GOBL FORGET WHERE HIDE TREASURE.<br />WHERE TREASURE? WHAT CAVE TREASURE IN? GOBL COMPLETE FORGET. GAAAAAH!”<br /><br />The above is a record of Gobl graffiti which has been carefully preserved by human researchers of beasts.<br />It was initially believed that no specimens of Gobl writing existed in the wild, so this graffiti is regarded as invaluable to researchers. Though researchers have searched feverishly for the possibly mutant Gobl which produced this graffiti, thus far their results have proven unfruitful.<br /><br />Some humans particularly familiar with Gobl behavior have theorized that the graffiti may be some kind of prank and the academic debate surrounding this graffiti specimen continues to rage even today.
