	<h4>Aldana's Eastern Port</h4>
	<strong>Unlock at Lv2</strong>
	<br /><br />
	Port Granada is a trading town located in east-central Aldana. A stable route from Granada to Ladour Island's Port Abelia allows for prosperous trade and fishing between the two.<br />This town has a long history: it's said that it was established as the continent's eastern port around the time the Holy Odal Kingdom added Aldana to its territories. It also serves as a trade link with the Kingdom of Lanzelia.<br />Initially, Port Lidel played this role, as it was closer to Lanzelia's Port Kardra. However, in order to get there, one had to traverse the perilous Gragia Mountains, so a second, more easily accessible port town became necessary.<br /><br />Eventually, Granada developed into the largest port town in Aldana, which they achieved by handling trade goods from the southern part of Lanzelia, and from Mordana via Badaal Port.<br />The goods collected in this area were transported to the cities of Aldana along the Lauza River, which flows by the northern ports, and valuable goods were thus picked up and brought into the Holy Odal Kingdom.<br />Though Port Aldana was considered more suitable for trade as a port town, the Holy Odal Kingdom had used Port Aldana as its military base, and therefore restricted trade, so Granada became the dominant port of the time.<br />It's said that the kingdom's policy was to not let the Aldana merchants become any richer than necessary.

	<h4>Granada's Nouveau Riche</h4>

	During the time Aldana was still under the rule of the Holy Odal Kingdom, Granada had basically monopolized the abundant trade, and the merchants built an enormous amount of wealth.<br />This period of prosperity lasted long enough that people started calling them the “new money of Granada”. Ironic, since most of these merchants had actually been sent from Odal, and the local Aldana merchants were not able to enter into such lucrative deals.<br /><br />Even among the Aldana merchants, however, there were those who built a fortune. The great merchant Radez was one of them.<br />Radez dealt with crops and marine products from Lanzelia, but he didn't just sell the goods he imported. He monopolized some Lanzelia-specific items, purposefully restricting the stock and selling the items at very high prices.<br />These products weren't vastly popular, and they were almost never seen in Aldana. However, the wealthy people of Odal saw them as rare curiosities, and as such, they became popular and sold well.<br /><br />Radez, whose rapidly accumulated wealth and luxurious lifestyle was well-known, rented out high-class restaurants used by officials from the Holy Odal Kingdom every night for dinner parties between himself and his merchant friends.<br />After Radez's death, it was his son who inherited the estate, but it's said the remaining fortune was next to none. During his lifetime, Radez would say, "One's estate should be limited to one generation. Inheriting assets only leads to a poisoning of the self."<br />It is impossible to judge whether he left so little to his son on purpose, or if it was the result of an uncontrolled lifestyle. The mansion that he erected is still left as a memorial of the history of Granada, and within it, visitors can come to know a bit more of what his life was like.

	<h4>A Bureaucrat at Work</h4>
	<strong>Unlock at Lv7</strong>

	It cannot be denied that Port Granada received assistance from the Holy Odal Kingdom.<br />However, Aldana’s fight for independence as instigated by Soleil, the son of the hero Adel, and the merchant upheaval that came of it, were invaluable to Port Granada’s growth.<br />This upheaval was resolved without any major problems because of the actions of one person: the Por Granada official, Sedalt.<br />Sedalt was originally from Odal, and by the time Aldana’s war for independence was over, he had lived in Granada for about 30 years. He was also in close contact with local merchants.<br /><br />About halfway through the war, it was clear that the continent would lose sovereignty over their land. The merchants from Odal were secretly preparing a return ship so that they could escape back to their homeland. <br />But after a large number of battles, the Aldana side now ruled the continent, so naturally the privileged Odal merchants became the target of the local citizens.<br />Sedalt, being a local merchant, spoke with the Odal merchants to make the following arrangements:<br />The Odal merchants were to leave a third of their current wealth in Granada to be transferred later. In return, Odal merchants could leave Granada with a guard fleet, their safety guaranteed until they returned to their nation.<br />The merchants accepted the compromise.<br /><br />Sedalt then spoke directly to Soleil. He asked for the merchants of Odal to be allowed to return under these conditions.<br />Soleil, who did not wish harm to non-combatants, even of the enemy side, entrusted him to arrange the merchants’ travel to Odal. <br />Thus, the effect that the Aldana war of independence had in Granada was minimal, with no blood shed to reach an agreement. Sedalt returned the Odal merchants to their country of origin, but he himself did not return to his homeland and remained in Granada.<br />If he had returned after negotiating with Soleil, the leader of Aldana’s independence movement, he could have been executed as a traitor. <br /><br />Sedalt might have lost his homeland, but the merchants in Granada nominated him for mayor. There were some in the independent government of Aldana that expressed concerns about leaving the important city to someone from Odal, but Soleil approved the nomination.<br />Sedalt was the first post-independence mayor of Granada, and was instrumental in the development of this port town.

	<h4>The Granada of Today</h4>
	<strong>Unlock at Lv10</strong>
	<br /><br />
	After the founding of Aldana Empire, trade restrictions on the western Port Aldana were lifted, so the port city of Granada did not have a concentration of excessive wealth as it had before.<br />However, it still shows its prosperity today in that it divides the world’s trade in two, and acts as the middleman for both Ladour and Lanzelia.<br />Furthermore, it has been a prosperous trade port since antiquity, and controlled the upheaval during the war of independence without an invading army, so the local merchants have good connections and a strong sense of independence with respect to political power.<br /><br />Currently, free trade is carried out under the jurisdiction of the Empire, and the merchant union formed by the mayor manages the distribution of goods. In order to prevent some merchants from becoming an overprivileged class, it is thought that the riches are being monitored through relatively fair voting to prevent wealth inequality.<br />Granada’s merchant association pays a certain amount of tax, and with the approval of its members, one can participate in trade regardless of their country or origin.<br /><br />However, some rumors claim that there are “VIP members”, and if you have this status, you can purchase rare pieces that are not usually sold in stores. In addition, in recent years, there have been many incidents where vessels departing Granada have been shipwrecked in the waters nearby.<br />There have been stipulations that it might be the pirate cove thought to be east of Granada, and the merchants are considering sending an investigation squad.
