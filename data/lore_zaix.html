	<h4>Elusive Knight</h4>
	<strong>Unlock at Lv10</strong>
	<br /><br />
	Zaix. A general of the Seventh Order of the Aldana Empire. The eternal knight in the mysterious agency, Grave Keeper. All on top of being a member of the Imperial Council, better known as the Council of Ten.<br /><br />The knights in the Seventh Order take after their leader, Zaix, and have permission to act independently even within the Imperial Guard. Their missions vary throughout the land, ranging from exterminating beasts to investigating the ruins of civilizations. Their tasks are so vast, they are sometimes referred to as “the handymen of the Empire.” Zaix often leaves the Seventh Order on their own to carry out his own personal missions.<br />Overseeing both organizations, Zaix’s variety of missions take him all over Granzelia. His range of missions is perhaps the most impressive amongst the knights of the Empire.<br /><br />Despite quite literally being all over, most information regarding him is questionable at best. While he has risen to the position amongst the Council of Ten, the backbone of the Empire, there are no records to show any extraordinary feats that are worthy of the position.<br />His obscured history aside, it is impossible that someone without merit or ability could rise to the position and be worthy enough to sit at the same table as Prince Roland himself.<br />It is rumored that there are a number of “confidential tasks” that Zaix has carried out to reach his current position. One of which may be to do the dirty work behind the scenes when Roland worked to establish the current system.<br /><br />Of course, while he has his position and perhaps his achievements, that doesn’t mean he gets along with the rest of the Council of Ten. His sarcastic nature and condescending attitude easily anger the other members. But Zaix would argue that it isn’t his fault that his sharp tongue cut into wounds as his snide remarks and hypocritical courtesy are given to everyone equally and without remorse. He doesn’t seem to concern himself with the feelings of others and continues to act the way he does.<br /><br />“Klah! Not surprising that there’s barely a handful that understands how valuable I am.”

	<h4>Best Fighter, Worst Temperament</h4>

	While Zaix has the potential to be found just about anywhere, he is rarely seen on the frontlines of battle against the forces of the Balze. Combat is a “means” but not an “end” to him. This way of thinking carries on to the Seventh Order as well. But because he chooses not to show himself on the battlefield does not mean he is incapable of fighting. One story gives a glimpse of what this man is capable of doing.<br /><br />Some time ago, Zaix had visited an unnamed village in Mordana for a mission. The task he was assigned is unknown, but it is presumed that he finished it early and this incident occurred as he tried to leave. One of the village elders had stopped Zaix, begging him to take down the demonic beast that preyed on the local farms. To the elder, Zaix was considered a high-ranking Imperial Knight with a reputation to uphold. However, Zaix’s response was dismissive and uncaring.<br /><br />“Huh? You’re ten-thousand years ahead of your time to ask me for small favors. The closest city is to the east, go and ask the Imperial Guards that’re stationed there. Those goons will dispatch someone after you send in a request.”<br /><br />Zaix went on to leave, continuing as if the elder had not stopped him.<br />This was the moment the beast in question had appeared. It started attacking anyone that was near. The terrified villagers gathered closer to Zaix, the children clinging to him.<br /><br />“Get off, you sniveling brats!”<br /><br />This attitude enraged the elder and the adults that were within earshot.<br /><br />“We are begging you, but you’re abandoning us?! Aren’t you a knight of the Empire? If this village turns to ruins because you refused to help, I will go to the Imperial Capital and tell them what happened today! I will ruin whatever reputation you have!”<br /><br />Upon hearing this, Zaix’s face hardly changed. As if he was expecting the backlash, he put his hands up with a long sigh.<br /><br />“Fine, I’ll admit, I have a job as an Imperial Knight. And unfortunately I have to do things I don’t want to to keep my job. This is what it means to be a servant to the masses…”<br /><br />With that, he shook off the children clinging to him and sauntered up to the beast. It noticed Zaix approaching and chose to close distance between them. The beast lunged towards the man with a fearsome roar and outstretched claws. But the claws never came in contact with him. In the blink of an eye, Zaix had cut the beast’s head off.<br /><br />The villagers that witnessed the incident claim that he took it down with his bare hands as it happened too quickly. They claimed Zaix didn’t have enough time to draw a sword despite the clean cut. But by the time villagers were relieved that the beast was defeated, Zaix had left without a trace.

	Official Empire Newsletter, Ragnarok. Featuring! The true identity of the Seventh Order!<hr />This newsletter was originally produced to help the citizens understand the structure and purposes of the Aldana Empire Military Organization. Today we would like to focus on the mysterious knights of the Seventh Order who seem to have their own agenda. Rumor has it that these knights have an assortment of missions all over Granzelia. Not only have they been all over, but they can do just about anything. Having the hardest screening test, the Seventh Order requires all members to have adept swordsmanship, advanced magical skills, and vast knowledge of ancient technologies.<br />The strict policies put in place makes this one of the smallest divisions. Here’s what Mr. Zaix had to say on the topic.<br /><br />“I don’t need screw-ups. Have too many and they’ll only be in the way.”<br /><br />Because they are so independent, they only need the people who can perform their duties with utmost precision.<br /><br />We also had a chance to interview one of the members of the Seventh Order. One of the senior members, making him closer to Mr. Zaix than the others as he occasionally oversees the activities of the Seventh Order when Zaix is absent.<br /><br />“The tasks given to us by Zaix aren’t easy. Not to mention he doesn’t tolerate mistakes. If you mess up too badly, you’d be discharged before you finished giving him your report. But the feeling you get when you can proudly come back after a successful mission? So rewarding.”<br /><br />He goes on about Mr. Zaix.<br /><br />“Zaix works solo because of his position and all the other special missions. It’s actually less common to accompany him on one. I’ve heard other people say that he’s thrown all his responsibilities out the window and pushed his work onto us. That’s not the case. That and I don’t know how he does it, but he knows what we do for each mission and if we mess up too badly or not.<br />I made a small mistake once. A minuscule one. But as soon as I walked into the capital, he knew. Instead of him getting the report, I got a harsh lecture and a reprimanding because of that tiny mishap.”<br /><br />Despite his carefree demeanor, it seems that Mr. Zaix commands the Seventh Order with an iron fist. We had managed to ask Mr. Zaix about what exactly Grave Keeper was, however…<br /><br />“Well aren’t you a fool for asking, let alone thinking I’d answer any questions you had about it.”<br /><br />All we could get was a sarcastic remark and silence. While the existence of Grave Keeper is publicly acknowledged, its feats have never been made public. Leading us to think… are we ready for whatever the answer could’ve been?

	<h4>One’s Memoirs</h4>
	<strong>Unlock at Lv80</strong>
	<br /><br />
	Here is a more personal note of mine.<br /><br />I work as a reporter for the Imperial Newsletter, Ragnarok. One day, the editorial department had asked me to do an article on the Seventh Order. We finally got a hold of Mr. Zaix and arranged an interview, as he was seldom found in the station offices.<br /><br />I was looking forward to the interview. They say Mr. Zaix has the most interesting personality amongst the Council of Ten. While I was graciously invited inside the Seventh Order’s station office, I felt a chill run up my spine. The rest of the divisions I had interviewed had a more relaxed, yet professional atmosphere. But here, you could feel the tension radiating off of everyone. The tension of where one mistake could cost a life.<br /><br />The star of the interview was seated at the far end of the room. The General of the Seventh Order, the Eternal Knight of Grave Keeper, one of the Council of Ten, Mr. Zaix himself.<br />I gave him my greetings as the person that greeted me at the door announced that I had arrived. Mr. Zaix didn’t seem interested in our interview, so I went to interview some of the other members of the Seventh Order.<br />Right as I finished speaking with another member, Mr. Zaix had approached from behind and lightly patted my shoulder.<br /><br />“So you’re the reporter that’s been nagging me for a story? It’s my job to answer some of the questions you have so let’s get this over with.”<br /><br />It was his usual, carefree and seemingly cheery tone, but his words were harsh. I had turned to face him just in time to see a malicious glint in his gaze before he turned to lead me back to his seat. His attitude was tainted with poison and far from friendly. His whole demeanor screamed “uncooperative”.<br /><br />In past articles, I had interviewed well-known heroes such as Mr. Davan and Mr. Lanceveil. As they preside over most of the militia of the Aldana Empire and everyone knew them, both men carried themselves with an air of dignity befitting of their position.<br />Oh but Mr. Zaix was nothing like the two. If they were all seen together, Mr. Zaix would look like an unwilling lackey compared to the two generals. But something else about him stood out and put him on a different level.<br /><br />I immediately had the hunch that this man would never give me a straight answer.<br /><br />The basic interview questions went smoothly. The answers Mr. Zaix gave were satisfactory for the article, but his tone was something else. He spoke in a way that made it seemed as if every word he said was nowhere near sincere. If he didn't give out any juicy information, there would be nothing to find out about the Seventh Order.<br />The pointed questions I asked didn’t bring out his true nature at all. His silver tongue danced around the questions. Always beating around the bush and never giving an answer. Some questions even backfired and I ended up being the one having to talk. I was so impatient. None of my questions could unnerve him. I had to improvise. Something that could throw him off guard. Something that would show me his true nature.<br /><br />“If I may ask, Mr. Zaix. Why do you wear a mask?”<br /><br />There were no ulterior motives behind the question, but his usual smirk faded to a somber expression. His tone went from smug to somewhat more quiet and serious.<br /><br />“The mask? Nobody’s ever asked about it, so I might as well tell.”<br /><br />Could this be the piece of information I was looking for for the article? He took a breath and started talking, fully serious.<br /><br />“When I was a tiny brat, I lived in some other tiny village. Bandits attacked, homes were pillaged and burned. Everyone that lived there was killed or left to die. My parents were in the group that got killed. I managed to get away from the bandits but the burning house I was in started to collapse on top of me. Thought I was going to die, but instead, I got some nasty burns.<br />Years later, I grew out of being a tiny brat and I start looking for the bandits that started all of this. I’m sure you’ve heard about how the Seventh Order goes all over the place, right? I still can’t find those bandits, and whenever I think of what they did to my parents, my blood boils and my burn scars hurt. Sure, I could fix up the scars and be thankful that I’m alive. But I’d rather keep them so I don’t forget to get my revenge on those criminals. I didn’t want everybody staring, so I had the blacksmith  make a mask to hide some of the nasty burns.”<br /><br />His posture was relaxed by the end of his story. The most relaxed I’ve ever seen him be. I suddenly felt sorry for him. My question was never meant to uncover such a past. I never thought that he would let himself tell a stranger his backstory.<br /><br />“I apologize for asking such a–“ I started.<br /><br />“Klah!” He interrupted with a laugh. “You nutjobs really would believe anything I told you!”<br /><br />And Mr. Zaix was back to his usual persona again.<br /><br />“What? So that whole story was a lie?”<br /><br />Mr. Zaix’s laughter continued, but he never answered that question.<br /><br />“Well, I’m sure you got enough answers from me. I look forward to an article that’ll get me famous in the Empire.”<br /><br />Then he patted me on the shoulder and left. How elusive. How rude. I doubt that anyone would be a fan of such a shallow man once they’ve heard him speak.<br />Everyone hates being lied to, so why wouldn’t he give me his true intentions? We know that Prince Roland is rather fond of Mr. Zaix, but does he understand this man? Does Mr. Zaix truly support Prince Roland or is he a two-faced agent? And if so, with whom?<br /><br />I left the station office with more questions than answers, even if most were fabricated by my own baseless theories.<br /><br />I am not a theorist that goes off the rails because of small crumbs of information. Nor am I a therapist that understands what he truly means when his answers dance around my questions. As a mere reporter, I don’t know if I have what it takes to understand this man.
