	<h4>Arcane Master</h4>

	Dyne is something of an enigmatic figure in history who appeared suddenly during the rule of the God of Ruin.<br />It is well-established that he wielded advanced magic and fought the disciples of the God of Ruin. Thus, he is thought to have been a magician.<br />However, considering his skill in battle, his understanding of medicine, and his broad breadth of general knowledge, the title of 'sage' seems more fitting for someone of his wisdom.<br /><br />His name appears over the course of hundreds of years, though only intermittently. This would mean he lived longer than any human possibly could, and since there are few accounts of him working together with people of his day, some propose that he himself wasn't human at all.<br />He was rarely seen in human settlements, but there are many who saw him entering ancient ruins. He was always with two others at those times, and the three of them together are referred to as 'The Three Sages'.<br />He didn't interact with anyone else and showed no interest in doing so, either. No one knows what the three were doing in the ruins, but rumors says they were studying magic.<br />Though there is no proof to back up these claims, it can't be denied that the Three Sages exhibited great powers when battling the disciples of the God of Ruin.<br /><br />Contemporary accounts suggest that they already possessed the strength necessary to defeat the disciples, leaving it unclear as to why they would seek further magical powers. The true intent of their actions remains a topic of scholarly debate to this day.

	We know from historical records that the Three Sages including Dyne acted separately from people living at the time. But that's not to say they had no interaction with them at all; the three are said to have effectively saved the lives of many.<br /><br />Once they were said to have stayed near a certain village. They seemed to have been investigating something, according to the records that remain, though no one knows what or why. It was at that time that the God of Ruin's disciples decided to attack humans and beasts alike.<br />Their sudden raid left both in a state of panic, but the Three Sages managed to calm everyone down and assemble a system for fighting back against the disciples.<br />The disciples were undeterred by this unexpected opposition and continued their attacks against humanity. However, humanity and beasts together followed Dyne and the others' instructions to maintain effective fighting formations and fend off the disciples.<br /><br />According to sources at the time, 'The Three Sages seemed less driven by an intense desire to defeat the disciples than by an eagerness to test out their fighting techniques and see what they could accomplish.'<br />Perhaps the fight against the disciples was just a chance for them to test whatever magical research they had been conducting in the ruins.<br /><br />Some hypothesize that the sages sought to obtain powers on par with the God of Ruin, greater than anything the disciples wielded. Legends tell of 'arcane magic' only usable by those who have mastered the essence of magic, so one theory is that the Three Sages believed in this and carried out magical experiments in the ruins to gain this power for themselves.

	<h4>Sage's Arrival</h4>
	<strong>Unlock at Lv50</strong>
	<br /><br />
	The Three Sages wielded incredible powers against the God of Ruin's disciples. Any one of them would've been a match for a thousand men, which is best illustrated through one of Dyne's fights.<br /><br />It happened when he once ventured off to work independently of the other two sages. He found himself surrounded by a large group of disciples and responded by barricading himself inside a hastily made fortress. Instead of facing them all head on, he engaged in a careful back-and-forth with them until they wore themselves out.<br /><br />Finally, they gave up and turned their backs on his fortress to leave. Having been heavily outnumbered, most people in his position would've been content just to see their enemy retreat, but not Dyne. To ensure his safety he used additional reserves of power to strike them down at just the right moment to inflict massive damage as they fled.<br /><br />This story shows his ability to choose an optimal strategy for the situation at hand, his seemingly inexhaustible reserves of magic, and an acute desire to defeat the disciples.<br />Rather, it is broadly accepted that he took this approach to see how far his magic had developed since his earlier attempts at fighting the disciples.<br /><br />Though nothing more than conjecture, it is possible that this battle made him confident in how far he'd progressed and led him to continue with his preparations to face the God of Ruin. However, there are no records that he was actually involved with sealing the God of Ruin during the Great War.<br />The period of a few centuries during which his name pops up again and again in history books had ended before the Great War even begun. Some suggest that defeating the God of Ruin was not the ultimate goal of his research at all.

	<h4>Immortality...?</h4>
	<strong>Unlock at Lv80</strong>
	<br /><br />
	The Sage Dyne appears many times throughout history, suggesting that he lived for hundreds of years. However, there are also long periods where he isn't mentioned at all, only to resurface again after a few decades when people had all but forgotten about him.<br /><br />While the timing of his reappearances seems to vary, there is one signal that reoccurs throughout the records just before he disappears. In each case he is reported to have secluded himself within ancient ruins.<br /><br />Thus many conclude that the secret to extending his life across such a long period of time is hidden inside the ruins. After he passed away this led some to surreptitiously investigate the ruins themselves.<br />A wall was discovered with engravings that no scholar could decipher, but with no traces of Dyne or the other sages those who went to investigate returned empty-handed.<br />The engravings on the wall are thought to be the key to understanding the Three Sages' history.<br /><br />Furthermore, someone who saw Dyne before and after a disappearance recalled, 'His body looked different than it had before.'<br />The changing physical appearance of the sage offers a clue to the wall. He must have used magic beyond the understanding of humanity on his own body in the ruins to extend its lifespan. Then perhaps something went wrong and he became unable to use this magic anymore, causing him to finally pass away.<br /><br />But did he achieve whatever it was he had hoped to? No one knows to this day.
