	<h4>Birth of a Hero</h4>
	<strong>Unlock at Lv2</strong>
	<br /><br />
	Near the Ruins of Kaldina on the continent of Odal, there was once a kingdom known as Norlean.<br />It was just one of many nations that resisted occupation by the Holy Odal Kingdom, but the battles that occurred at the time have attracted the attention of several historians and inspired them to publish research books and theses on the subject.<br />Of particular note is that Norlean, under the command of one lone knight, earned several victories against the overwhelmingly superior military might of the Holy Odal Kingdom.<br />This knight’s name was Randell.<br />Randell was born into the lowest tier of the Norlean royal family, but due to his lineage, he was neglected by the king and his legitimate children, and forced into military service at a young age.<br /><br />Randell joined the war against the Holy Odal Kingdom about a month in, but by that time, the situation was dire: Odal was breaking through line after line of Norlean defenses, advancing ever closer to the capital.<br />Any further retreat of the front lines had to be avoided at all costs. Therefore, the military commanders planned to position the troops directly in front of the enemy in order to obstruct any further encroachment.<br /><br />Before they could do so, however, Randell raised an objection.<br />“Facing the enemy head-on will only lead to a war of attrition.”<br />Noticing that the Holy Odal Kingdom’s line of supply was stretching itself thin, Randell proposed they cut off that line as an alternative way of breaking down the enemy forces.<br />However, his proposal was rejected for the following reason: “Our chivalrous order looks down upon such guerrilla tactics”.<br /><br />Neglected by the king and the royal family, Randell was likewise granted little respect by the military’s top brass. In a sense, their response was only inevitable. They feared that if they showed Randell support, the king could order their dismissal.<br /><br />“I guess there’s no point in talking…”<br /><br />Knowing his voice fell on deaf ears, Randell made up his mind. If he could not get approved for a large-scale deployment of troops, then he would carry out his tactics with his own small platoon.<br />He, along with some trusted subordinates, split off from the main body of troops and quickly sneaked past enemy lines. While the front lines were still sharp, the rear lines of the Holy Odal Kingdom’s army were already being convinced of their victory and had become careless.<br /><br />Upon discovering the enemy’s sloppily guarded supplies, Randell gave his subordinates the following order:<br /><br />“Aim only for the food and supplies! Light them on fire and we won’t have to fight the enemy directly!”<br /><br />Having snuck into the heart of the enemy camp, Randell’s platoon launched an ideal surprise attack, throwing the enemy into chaos and incinerating their supplies all at once.<br />By the time the enemy troops got back on their feet, Randell’s platoon had already made their brilliant escape. Afterward, Randell continued to appear unexpectedly before the enemy and attack their supply line, successfully crushing each section and capturing the supplies.<br />Once supplies began to dwindle, the Holy Odal Kingdom’s army could no longer advance, cementing their defeat; they were forced to retreat temporarily.<br /><br />Randell’s exploits were such a driving force in Norlean’s victory that not even the king could ignore it, and so to honor his achievements, he was promoted to general. However, this promotion meant that Randell would bear full responsibility for the war against the Holy Odal Kingdom.

	The Holy Odal Kingdom may have temporarily retreated from Norlean, but they did not abandon the invasion outright. It was clear as day that they would go on the offensive again soon enough.<br />While Norlean had not yet fully recovered from the previous invasion’s efforts, the enemy also needed time before they would be ready for a full-on assault.<br /><br />Randell drafted a plan to take the initiative and challenge the Holy Odal Kingdom while both sides were recovering, and through that victory, crush the enemy’s morale. However, the king disapproved of the strategy; as if in agreement, the other generals shot it down as well.<br />Once more, Randell would have to carry out this mission himself with only a small squad at his command.<br /><br />“I’m on my own again, huh…<br />Well, some things are just easier to do with your own hands.”<br /><br />After lining up his troops at the border of the Holy Odal Kingdom, Randell used the pretext of a military exercise to move forward and skilfully provoke Odal’s border patrol.<br />The Holy Odal Kingdom’s soldiers saw Norlean as nothing more than a small, worthless country, and scoffed at this display of power. It was hardly a challenge to lure the guards into battle positions, so they easily fell for the provocation.<br />However, Randell’s target was not the guards at all, but the battalion behind them, which was stationed there to prepare for the next Norlean invasion. He fought not to destroy the Odal guard, but to prolong the fight as long as possible in order to corner them.<br />Begrudgingly, the guards called for backup from the battalion behind them – Randell’s true target. Upon hearing the call, the battalion rushed to the battlefield, but that was the moment Randell had been waiting for.<br /><br />“Looks like we finally caught the big one.”<br /><br />Randell personally led a separate ambush on the enemy troops during their march. After a fierce battle, his squad successfully destroyed the battalion.<br />His mission accomplished, Randell withdrew the soldiers that had been fighting the guards, and headed back tot he capital.<br /><br />After losing the battalion meant for the second invasion of Norlean, the Holy Odal Kingdom rushed to reorganize its troops, and had no choice but to abandon the invasion for the time being.

	<h4>Hekilda's War</h4>
	<strong>Unlock at Lv7</strong>
	<br /><br />
	The last battle dealt a heavy blow to the Holy Odal Kingdom, but eventually, their army recovered and resumed their invasion of Norlean. Meanwhile, the Norlean side of the conflict also managed to complete their defense, but the difference in the two forces was quite considerable, and they were still at a disadvantage.<br /><br />As a general, Randell could participate in making defense strategies, but he initially held back from speaking during war councils. As the generals were faced with the enemy threat, they tried everything they could do to slow the invasion.<br />Randell’s next opportunity to leap into action came after the Holy Odal Kingdom’s forces had taken over the majority of western Norlean.<br /><br />“In this situation, we should…”<br /><br />He quickly gathered the generals and held a war council where he proposed the following tactic: they would feign a decisive, head-on battle; meanwhile, he would lead a separate platoon through the Hekilda Mountain Range in North Kaldia and surprise the enemy from behind with a pincer attack.<br />However, the Hekilda Mountain Range was treacherous, and while an individual might be able to cross it, it would be no easy task for an army. At first glance, it seemed like a suicide mission, but upon hearing Randell out, the generals agreed.<br />After all, he had gained their trust through his repeated victories in otherwise hopeless battles.<br />Thus, the tactic was put into motion.<br /><br />Randell’s forces quickly advanced through the treacherous mountains, but since they were plotting a pincer attack, they obviously needed to coordinate with the other groups. They had no time to spare, and so he alternated between encouraging his troops, and rebuking them, as they made their way across the unmarked path.<br />But the rough mountains and the fatigue caught up to them, until finally some soldiers started to fall.<br />They were in no position to march, much less fight.<br /><br />It was then that they spotted something at the summit of the mountain: a flag. It was a Norlean flag that Randell had planted at the top beforehand.<br /><br />“Soldiers,” he cried, “victory is just beyond that peak.<br />Now is the time for you to save your nation… No, your loved ones!”<br /><br />The sight of Randell standing before the flag of their fatherland revitalized the soldiers, and they finally crossed through the Hekilda Mountain Range.<br /><br />As the main forces of the Norlean army began fighting with the Holy Odal Kingdom, they launched their surprise attack from behind, smashing through the bewildered enemy lines.<br />At this time, Randell took the enemy’s lead commander prisoner in what was perhaps his greatest achievement.<br />This battle, which would later be known as the Battle of Hekilda, would become a model for military tactics and a story inseparable from Randell’s history.<br />The battle would also be Randell’s last.

	<br /><br />
	Now that Randell had thwarted the Norlean invasion thrice over, the Holy Odal Kingdom realized a conventional assault would not be enough to take over the nation. Therefore, they devised a new strategy: to tell the king of Norlean that they would agree to peace talks in exchange for General Randell as a prisoner.<br />As the king had shunned Randell since birth, he readily agreed to the proposal, and Randell was immediately imprisoned.<br />At first, Randell was surprised, but quickly caught on, and offered no resistance. Before he was handed over to the Holy Odal Kingdom, he met with his king and simply said, “Take care.”<br /><br />When he was handed over to the Holy Odal Kingdom, Randell was quickly sentenced to execution. But in the time leading up to his execution, he was treated surprisingly well. Though he was an enemy, the knights and soldiers of the Holy Odal Kingdom respected his accomplishments, as he had time and time again destroyed battalions far larger than his own.<br />On the day of his execution, Randell had this to say to a certain general hwo had visited him frequently:<br /><br />“While I may have the blood of the royal Norlean family, I did not fight for the king. I fought for my subordinates and the citizens who loved me.<br />If I may have one last request, please do not treat them coldly.”<br /><br />After Randell’s execution, the Holy Odal Kingdom complied and engaged in peace talks with Norlean, but soon found excuses to go back on their word.<br />They invaded once more, and this time, subjugated Norlean in no time at all.<br />The nation fell to ruin, and the king was executed, but Randell’s subordinates and the citizens were treated with tolerance as per the firm request of the Holy Odal Kingdom’s military authorities.<br /><br />Concerning the death of Randell and the fall of Norlean, novelist and longtime Odal historian Calnum writes:<br />“Randell was both the hope of Norlean and a symbol of the nation.<br />In the Battle of Hekilda, he stood before the nation’s flag and inspired its soldiers, but he himself was a sort of holy, living flag.<br />After offering up their own flag to the enemy, it was only a matter of time before Norlean fell and its king was executed.”
