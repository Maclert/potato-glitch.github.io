	<h4>For Revenge</h4>
	<strong>Unlock at Lv10</strong>
	<br /><br />
	In the age when the God of Ruin ruled Granzelia, there lived a woman feared by man and beast alike, known as the "Soul Reaper".<br /><br />There was a time when she challenged the God of Ruin with her two comrades, but suffered an utter defeat that led her to become an enemy of humanity.<br /><br />Melza's journey brought her to the blade and was said to be capable of striking down the God of Ruin. She set off to defeat this fiend with her comrades, one a swordsman of flames, and another a knight of ice.<br />However, when they reached the castle, they found one of the Generals of Ruin, who ruled over the God of Ruin's followers, blocking their path. The three of them had already felled countless of the god's followers, but the General's power was above and beyond any they had faced before. It was enough to convince them that, even if they could somehow defeat the General, they would not win against the God of Ruin itself.<br />Drawing her blade, Melza readied herself to at least take down this foe, even if it killed her. But then, the swordsman and the knight stepped out ahead of her.<br />They turned to Melza and told her to run while they kept the General of Ruin at bay. Shocked at their ultimatum, Melza demanded to fight alongside them, but the swordsman of ice returned a stern rebuke:<br />"You mustn't forget your goal! You'll never reach it if you die here!"<br /><br />The knight of flame took her silence as his cue to step in.<br />"C'mon, who d'ya think we are? It'll take more than some lackey to beat us. Now run off home before you get in the way. Heck, take the ice queen with ya if you need a travel companion."<br /><br />As she watched the ice and fire bicker, Melza made up her mind. She told them she would be waiting. She fled at once, not turning back until she reached the nearest town that could ferry her across the ocean.<br /><br />She ran with the conviction that her comrades wouldn't be that far behind. However, it was neither the knight nor the swordsman who appeared before her, but a battle-scarred General of Ruin.<br /><br />At once, he spoke. And with his words went the last shred of hope and resolve she had.

	<h4>Bad News and a Nightmare</h4>

	<br /><br />
	The General of Ruin's words... were the ones the knight and the swordsman had spoken with their dying breaths. Melza initially refused to believe him, but in the General's hands were none other than her comrades' beloved blades.<br /><br />A battle ensued, but with all the morale she had built pulled out from under her feet, Melza soon fell. One of the general's underlings delighted in her misery and closed in to puer her out of it, but his superior stopped his hand. He explained that killing her would defy the God of Ruin's wishes: Melza's death could lead the humans to view her as a heroic martyr who had rebelled against a tyrannical god.<br /><br />There were better uses for rabble like her, so they brought her to the God of Ruin's feet. The God of Ruin, however, had no interest in such uses, and left her disposal to his general's discretion. The General of Ruin's first act was to punish Melza's heresy by eradicating her hometown. He then demanded that the ruler of the Kingdom be held accountable for treating Melza has his personal favorite knight, and announced that the attacks would continue until he received a satisfactory answer.<br /><br />Public opinion shifted swiftly against the royalty. The aristocracy had always been widely resented, but this proved to be catalyst for a massive revolution.<br />Amid the chaos, the king was executed by his own people, who went on to establish the Mordana Republic against the dwindling royal forces. Melza's heart broke even further upon hearing of these events. And in her despair, the General of Ruin gave her a final ultimatum...<br /><br />"The Master is furious. The flames of his wrath will not abate with Mordana... Oh no, they will envelop every human in Granzelia. But if you swear to be my servant, then his anger might be assuaged."<br /><br />Melza, lacking the willpower to object, swore to join the God of Ruin's followers. Once she did, her sacred blade distorted and twisted into a scythe so cursed it could have been lifted from the bowels of hell. The spirit residing inside it warped into the reaper, Loug Dahna.

	<h4>The First Sin</h4>
	<strong>Unlock at Lv50</strong>
	<br /><br />
	Upon her inauguration into the God of Ruin's followers, the first task assigned to Melza was to assassinate a general in her former homeland of Mordana. He was famous as a battle-hardened veteran who never put himself above his troops. He retained his position even after the revolution and continued to oversee the country's army. He was a man Melza knew well. A man she owed many a debt to during her days as a knight in her motherland.<br />Melza was no fool. She could tell that her admiration was why he had been her first assigned target.<br /><br />"They're testing my loyalty..."<br /><br />Melza returned to Mordana in secret, and through her information gathering learned that the general would be leaving the capital to patrol a number of outposts around the countryside. Deciding that it would be best to strike while he traveled between the two, Melza set off to trail him and his troops.<br />When night fell, she entered his tent disguised as a soldier, snuck up behind him, and brought her hidden scythe down upon his neck. But she didn't expect what happened next. The general swung around and stared Melza down. In that instant, their eyes met.<br /><br />The memories of everything had done for her floated up from the back of her mind. When Melza had been nervous about being among the other rookies on her first deployment, he patted her on the back and told her to relax. When Melza had saved the king from a monster attack, he made sure to endorse her so that she would get the reward she deserved. For a moment, Melza froze. But she knew that averting the path of the scythe she swung wasn't an option.<br />The only way she could quell the God's anger, the only way she could save as many people as possible... was to serve as the God of Ruin's servant.<br /><br />"I'm sorry..."<br /><br />Melza's scythe severed the general's throat and took his life. She left the tent without his troops suspecting a thing.<br />Melza's first mission as a servant was a success. And with her first mission came the first sin to gnaw upon her heart.

	<h4>Unforgettable Curse</h4>
	<strong>Unlock at Lv80</strong>
	<br /><br />
	After successfully assassinating the general from her homeland, Melza was soon tasked with suppressing rebellions against the God of Ruin's rule.<br />For this task, she was given two objectives:<br />First, she was to assassinate enemy leaders to sow disorder, giving an advantage to the God of Ruin. However, she was strictly told to remain undetected. After all, these feeble humans were being smited by the power of the God of Ruin and his faithful followers. The existence of agents like Melza was to be kept secret.<br />The other objective shew as given was to clean up the surviving enemies and execute all who assisted them. Unlike before, she was ordered to make her presence known so that the people could see that their last glimmer of hope had been corrupted into the personification of despair.<br /><br />"I'm... sorry..."<br /><br />Melza still apologized as she reaped scores of innocent lives with her scythe. However, her words lacked the feeling they once held. She had taken far too many lives to still be capable of speaking with emotion.<br /><br />And yet, the God of Ruin's followers never ceased their surveillance of her.<br /><br />This was made clear after she quelled an uprising in a town on the southern end of Aldana. While she performed her routine eradication of survivors, Melza followed orders and slaughtered all, whether they resisted or not... until she noticed a few children cowering in a back alley at the sight of her. Melza didn't hesitate to raise her scythe, but when her eyes laid upon one of the children's faces, a rush of memories came back to her. Memories of the town where she once resolved to defeat the God of Ruin.<br />In that moment, the drive to protect others that Melza once had, found its way back into her heart.<br /><br />"Run away..."<br /><br />Her voice was faint, as though it was all the resistance she could muster. The children looked both surprised and confused, not knowing what to make of what Melza told them, but after some trepidation, they took her advice.<br /><br />Once Melza had exterminated enough stragglers to get a moment to breathe, a voice rang out in her head. It belonged to none other than the General of Ruin.<br /><br />"I will forgive your mistake just this once. But the agonizing fate you'll meet will not change. Just like the one those children met."<br /><br />Melza went pale at his words and hurried off in the same direction as the children had gone. She clung to the sliver of hope that they were still safe... but all that awaited her was their horrifically mutilated corpses.<br /><br />From that day forth, Melza carried out her missions from the God of Ruin's followers in complete silence. Her eyes now lacked even the faintest shred of hope. All that remained was the emptiness of abject despair.<br />People would go on to fear her as the reaper who betrayed humanity...<br /><br />There exist no further records concerning what became of her. Many have theorized but it's unlikely we'll have anything beyond mere speculation.<br /><br />People of modern times tend to judge her life in one of two ways:<br />Some see her as a grim reaper whose senseless defiance of the God of Ruin brought about far greater ruin.<br />Others see her as a tragic heroine whose bold rebellion cost her everything.<br />How one chooses to judge her varies from person to person, but perhaps it matters not how she's judged. No eulogy can change the amount of lives she's taken.
