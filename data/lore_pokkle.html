	<h4>Little Forest Beings</h4>
	<strong>Unlock at Lv10</strong>
	<br /><br />
	Pokkle are mysterious creatures which are sometimes referred to as the “dwarves of the forest”.<br />Their existence has been known since pre-historical times. At one point, they were believed to be a type of fairy, but recent studies have demonstrated that they do in fact possess a corporeal form.<br />Although they are generally classified as beasts, they are technically half-fairy and half-beast. And though they vary at an individual level in terms of their size, on average their height is roughly around that of a normal human's knees.<br /><br />Although they are generally silent and rarely speak, they are capable of both understanding and speaking human language. There are records of past researchers interacting with Pokkle, which suggests that their intelligence is substantially higher than their appearance would suggest.<br /><br />They are known to consume “Hottle nuts” as a staple food. In larger settlements, Pokkle will create farms where they harvest the nuts.<br /><br />In general, Pokkle are not solitary creatures, and in most cases, prefer to work in groups of three. Though the reason for this particular trait is unknown, it is speculated that in each group, an older Pokkle showing distinct coloration, is looked after by two younger Pokkle, and that this is the basis of their lifestyle.

	<h4>Disappearing Pokkle</h4>
	<strong>Unlock at Lv30</strong>
	<br /><br />
	Pokkle are regarded as mysterious creatures. Perhaps one of the greatest mysteries concerning them is the fact that no one has ever reported discovering a Pokkle cadaver.<br /><br />When one looks at places where Pokkle are believed to congregate, one may find crudely constructed houses, but no signs of any kind of graveyard.<br />Additionally, there have been many cases throughout history where humans and Pokkle have fought together against a common outside enemy. In such cases, though Pokkle have been known to suddenly disappear, nobody has ever reported finding the body of a defeated Pokkle on the battlefield.<br /><br />It is of course possible that these Pokkle simply flee the battle without so much as a word, or that they simply leave under the impression that they are no longer needed. On the other hand, some legends tell of how Pokkle return to the soil as nutrients when their life is extinguished.

	<h4>Traveling</h4>

	<br /><br />
	While Pokkle are generally of a cowardly disposition and will try and avoid encounters with humans wherever possible, they are also known to frequently observe us from the shadows.<br />They also display a keen interest in tools used by humans and whenever a set of tools left in the forest is stolen, you can bet that it is the doing of the Pokkle.<br /><br />Even though it is expected that individuals belonging to the same race should show some degree of individual variation it is interesting to note that these so-called 'traveling Pokkle' have been found to exist in a certain proportion within all Pokkle tribes.<br />Some researchers speculate that the Pokkle, who generally live close to the soil and Nature, require plant seeds that must be imported from afar. Their genetic makeup is such that a certain proportion of individuals belonging to their race are imbued with an instinctive need to wander.<br />Furthermore, traveling Pokkle are known to always move in groups of three.

	<h4>A Habit</h4>
	<strong>Unlock at Lv80</strong>
	<br /><br />
	Pokkle generally possess a gentle nature and will seldom attack humans.<br />However, they show little mercy to those who encroach on their territory. Many tales tell of travelers who become lost in the forest, and inadvertently trespass on land inhabited by Pokkle.<br /><br />One such traveler was forced to flee in a daze after being suddenly attacked by a band of Pokkle. The disoriented traveler is reported to have made his way around the forest blindly, but before he knew it, he was able to find the way out of the forest.<br /><br />Though some claim the traveler was simply the beneficiary of dumb luck, still others say that the traveler was led out of the forest by the Pokkle, who merely pretended to attack.
