	<h4>Double Edged Beauty</h4>
	<strong>Unlock at Lv10</strong>
	<br /><br />
	Sevia, hailing from the port city of Granada on the east side of the continent of Aldana, is well known for her exploits as a treasure hunter.<br />Many accounts remain of her exploits in search of treasures throughout the various kingdoms. Legends tell of how she infiltrated a foreign land, defeated a fearsome company of warriors belonging to the local sovereign and succeeded brilliantly in seizing a vast fortune of treasure.<br /><br />The secret to her success lay in her outstanding swordsmanship. Rumor has it that she developed her own unique dual-wielding style based on the teachings of a famous contemporary master swordsman under whom she studied.<br /><br />It is said that once she perfected her art, she roamed around visiting ancient ruins, where she would challenge looters she encountered to combat.<br />Rather than steal treasure for herself, Sevia tried to instead drive the looters she encountered from the ancient sites they attempted to desecrate, to protect both the ruins and the treasures that lay within. Though it is unclear what exactly motivated the self-styled 'treasure hunter' to suddenly take an interest in protecting the treasures she was ostensibly supposed to steal, there is no question that many such ruins were protected thanks to her efforts.<br /><br />There were many a time when Sevia would visit a certain port town to collect information on lost treasure and the ruins where they could be found. She gradually became a familiar face among the locals. Proof of the familiarity with which the townsfolk regarded her can be found in an old shop in that same port town.<br />There it is stated:<br />“The atmosphere here has changed since Sevia came back from the ruins to which she originally set off to find treasure. She came back carrying a large object and a somber look on her face, as though she was now compelled by some kind of mission…"<br /><br />What actually befell the young treasure hunter remains unknown.

	<h4>Pact With a Bandit</h4>
	<strong>Unlock at Lv30</strong>
	<br /><br />
	Shortly after making it her apparent mission to protect ancient ruins, Sevia had an unexpected encounter with a notable bandit.<br /><br />Said bandit had gained popularity among the local peasantry for his unique brand of 'philanthropy' in which he would often distribute a share of the lucre he stole from the rich nobility, to the poor and defenseless.<br />However, the bandit and self-styled friend of the common folk had for some reason, found himself in a standoff with Sevia while visiting the same ruins. The battle over the treasure which lay in those same ruins is also recorded in stories depicting the exploits of the bandit and, where Sevia is described as “a certain swordswoman”.<br /><br />The battle was fierce, with neither side giving the other an inch, and in the end it appears that the bandit did not succeed in acquiring the treasure he sought to steal. This suggests that the ensuing battle was not simply a victory for Sevia or a defeat of the bandit, and that Sevia may have come to blows with the bandit knowing full well that the latter had come to the ruins for purposes other than the pilfering of treasure.<br /><br />This theory is supported by another account which claims that Sevia and the bandit fought together against another bandit who appeared in the ruins sometime after their initial encounter.<br />Though it remains unclear exactly for what purpose the two fought in secret, Sevia earned some measure of underground fame as a swordswoman capable of going toe-to-toe with the famous bandit.<br /><br />It was shortly thereafter that the shadow of another man whose own ambition resonated with Sevia and the bandit, began to appear in popular accounts. He was a man of considerable new wealth, who was responsible for the discovery of the Mines of Gorde.

	<h4>Courted by a Millionaire</h4>
	<strong>Unlock at Lv50</strong>
	<br /><br />
	Sevia's affinity for exploring ruins is confirmed in the writings of a wealthy man who built an empire of riches after discovering the Mines of Gorde.<br />The man was said to have visited various archaeological ruins in order to gain greater insight into how best to govern his country. It was during one such excursion that the wealthy man came upon Sevia and the bandit, still locked in combat.<br /><br />Thereafter, the man started to mention Sevia with increasing frequency in his personal notes. Though the man had apparently developed feelings for Sevia, his affection was reportedly unrequited.<br /><br />“Recently, I've become troubled by a man who frequently appears in the ruins. Even so, I don't plan on taking any extreme measures as he is always careful not to disturb the ruins and has never tried to take any treasure."<br /><br />For his part, the man claimed in his writings that Sevia gave him a handkerchief as a sign of her love for him, but it seems that the truth of the matter may have been a bit different. Sevia is reported to have complained of her plight to one of the local townsfolk who knew her.<br /><br />“That man I was telling you about earlier injured himself at the ruins while I was busy dealing with an unruly bandit. Since it is forbidden to desecrate the ruins with blood, I passed the man a handkerchief given to me by an old man whilst on the road. <br />Ever since then, the guy has become even more persistent and to be honest he's really starting to bother me.”<br /><br />Though it is likely that Sevia harbored no ill will toward the wealthy man, it appears that she still had no plans to entertain his affections. However, the man is said to have actually helped Sevia on occasion, so it is clear that his actions went beyond simple sightseeing or merely expressing his affections for the young swordswoman.

	<h4>Fighting and...</h4>
	<strong>Unlock at Lv80</strong>
	<br /><br />
	Word of Sevia's successful foiling of the bandit's attempt to plunder the ruins spread quickly throughout the land. Unfortunately for Sevia, her exploits had made her a common enemy among all who sought treasure in the ruins.<br /><br />Alarmed and afraid, a coalition of bandits was organized to target Sevia herself, and shortly thereafter the swordswoman found herself trapped while exploring a new section of ruins.<br />It is said that the bandit who had already fought with Sevia countless times appeared before a desperate Sevia in her hour of need, and rescued her from certain death. From this, we may deduce that the bandit likely came to the ruins for purposes other than simple plunder, and may have shared certain common interests with Sevia.<br /><br />As the other bandits bore down on Sevia and her new comrade, the pair quickly found themselves overwhelmed by sheer numbers. It was at that moment that the wealthy man, having tracked Sevia's whereabouts, finally rendezvoused with the struggling swordswoman.<br />The wealthy man, who was not a regular witness to the battles waged between Sevia and the bandit, stepped forward to try and help the pair.<br />A record of the battle that ensued was included in the wealthy man's personal notes, including details revealing his feelings at the time.<br /><br />“What a refreshing thing to witness those who fight for their beliefs as part of a shared aspiration.”<br /><br />Though the man's interest in Sevia may have been initially driven by infatuation, seeing the swordswoman in actual battle no doubt stirred something else inside of him.<br />The wealthy man also seems to have had some connection to the bandit as well, which gives an even greater gravity to his words above. In the wealthy man's personal notes, Sevia's battle in the ruins ends with the trio fighting alongside one another with no further comments given, and the whereabouts of the swordswoman remains a mystery to this day.
