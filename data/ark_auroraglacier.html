	<h4>The Mysterious Land</h4>
	<strong>Unlock at Lv2</strong>
	<br /><br />
	There are many places in Lanzelia that are difficult for people to visit due to the cold climate and complex terrain.<br />As such, there are several unexplored territories on the map, and so tales and folklore are the only clues we have as to the state of each area.<br />One of these legends tells of the area called Aurora Glacier, which is said to be somewhere on this continent. An ever-present snowstorm blows in this area, freezing the land, and not a whisper of life can be heard.<br />For a living creature, it feels like the very end of the world.<br />But despite the impression, the place is popular with some adventurers. As the name suggests, it is possible to see a snow rainbow, which cannot be seen anywhere else.<br />Some adventurers have set their sights on the area and managed to catch a glimpse of the snow rainbow, but there is little record to confirm any information about the area itself.<br />Even so, one of the few materials we succeeded in obtaining is the record of an explorer who made it to the Aurora Glacier, and we will soon make its contents available. Although there are some parts of the record that are faded and difficult to read, the original text is written verbatim in our work to reproduce the record accurately.<br /><br />–Excerpt from “Mysteries of Lanzelia”

	<h4>In Search of the Snowy Rainbow</h4>

	It’s been years since I looked for the Aurora Glacier.<br />I finally arrived.<br />In these logs, I will describe my investigation process and the events that transpired as I worked my way here.<br />First, I started collecting information in a port city of Lanzelia, the continent where the site exists. However, the results there were unfavorable.<br />I could only dig up stories that were rumors within rumors, so needless to say it took time to verify the information I received.<br />Still, I listened with persistence.<br />The only reliable voices were the ones of the people from the area. As a result of my repeated investigations, I was able to find what seemed like a confirmed answer that the destination was far to the northeast of the port town.<br />Making further inquiries, it seems that you have to cross several snowy mountains to get from here to the Aurora Glacier.<br /><br />Apparently, the rumors stayed as only rumors because the route was too steep and no one was able to prove the existence of the place.<br />I understood the direction to go and the barriers that I must overcome. The rest was how to get to the destination. After careful consideration, a round trip would be better than a steep, snow mountain path, but I decided that it would be better to go along the sea route so I aimed for the Aurora Glacier by boat.<br /><br />However, the sea is not an easy route either.<br />In the midst of my journey, I was assailed by marine Beasts many times, and had to sail while fighting them off. Though the biggest hindrance wasn’t so much the Beasts as the pirates conquering the Granzelia seas.<br />I’m glad to have had a captain that speaks my language. We came to a deal about the fare to pass through, after them asking about my assets. I felt a little regret, giving the rogues the treasure that I had struggled to save, but I had to keep sight of my priorities.<br />My purpose was to make it to that place. Wheeling and dealing with pirates was nothing.<br />This probably took many times longer than traveling on land, but even so, I still believe that it was right to prioritize certainty rather than speed.<br />After months of sailing, I finally landed on the land of the snow rainbow.<br /><br />– Excerpt from an explorer’s logs in “Mysteries of Lanzelia”

	I will go on to record the events after I arrived at the Aurora Glacier. There were some differences between the stories and the place itself. Without a doubt, my first impression of this place was definitely the inability to hear any breath of life in the deathly cold snowstorm raging about.<br />However, there were a few living creatures, and people living there – the likes of whom I had never seen before. Especially conspicuous among these people was the existence of an enormous archer. He looked very different from the rest of the residents.<br />He stood out like a Beast, covered with pure white hair and a strapping physique; I felt an oppressive air from him.<br />But when I talked to him, he was unexpectedly friendly, and once I told him that I was there to see the snow rainbow, he was willing to take me to the place where I could see it.<br /><br />As he was leading me there, he told me about himself.<br />He said, “I was also a stranger at first, go injured and happened upon the place. Then I lived here after the locals helped me. I want to be kind to outsiders that aren’t hostile, like they were to me.”<br /><br />So, with his help, I arrived at a place where I could see the snow rainbow.<br />It was what I would call an absolutely sublime view. It was even colder there than the archer’s home ground, and just being there was painful, but the brilliance of the snow rainbow stole my heart away so strongly that I forgot about the freezing cold.<br />I will never forget that beautiful sight.<br />Of course, it will sit with the memories of my furry friend with a heart of gold who didn’t think twice about leading a stranger to the spectacle.<br />Thus, I have ascertained the site from which the snow rainbow can be seen. It is clear from my investigations so far that here is where “it” lies.<br />From here on out is critical.<br />I’ll definitely find it, you’ll see.<br /><br />– Excerpt from an explorer’s logs in “Mysteries of Lanzelia”

	Currently, no more of the Aurora Glacier explorer’s log has been found. As far as we can tell from the last things he recorded, he had no other destinations in mind after seeing the Aurora Glacier.<br />So what exactly was he searching for?<br />Inspired by his log, many adventurers have taken various methods, like boat, skyship, and the mountain path he did not take, in order to seek out the Aurora Glacier and find what exactly he was looking for.<br />But not a single soul has succeeded him. Even so, this doesn’t stop people from trying.<br />Perhaps they are driven by the rumors that followed the publication of his log, stating that what he had been searching for was precious treasure.<br /><br />The question here is that if the rumors were true, wouldn’t the explorer in question have already claimed the treasure himself?<br />But since nobody has been able to trace the explorer’s steps beyond what is written in his log, that question remains unanswered and has not stopped anyone.<br /><br />Opinions among the public are split. Some theorize he obtained the treasure he sought and gained vast fortunes before disappearing somewhere, while others suggest the treasure he tried to take was guarded by locals, who became enraged at his intrusion, and destroyed all trace of him.<br />All who set out for the Aurora Glacier fail to obtain that treasure of his, but they believe the treasure remains sleeping there and continue to search for it, dreaming of the riches that may one day be theirs.<br /><br />– Excerpt from “Mysteries of Lanzelia”
