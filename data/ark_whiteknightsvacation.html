	<h4>A Brief Vacation</h4>
	<strong>Unlock at Lv2</strong>
	<br /><br />
	“Ah, it feels great to be here!”<br /><br />Dressed in her swimsuit, Melza was relaxing at the beach, sprawled on a deck chair.<br />She was enjoying her first vacation in a long time at this private beach, which was actually part of a villa owned by a noble.<br /><br />This all began a few days ago.<br />As the wielder of Spirit Blade Maurius, Melza was on a quest to defeat Logseus, the God of Ruin. Melza was separated from her two teammates and was on her way to regroup with them. That was when she met Nomas, a noble who invited her to his villa.<br /><br />“What absolute pleasure it is for me to meet the great White Knight Melza. Please, I would like to invite you to my villa and learn about your aspiration to subjugate the God of Ruin.”<br /><br />Melza couldn’t reject Nomas’s offer after hearing what he said.<br />Certainly, her ultimate goal was to defeat the God of Ruin, but at the same time, it was meaningful for her to tell the people why it was necessary to defy the dominating rule.<br />Seemingly impressed by her visions, Nomas further offered another suggestion to her.<br /><br />“I heard that the meeting location for your party is near my villa, and that there are still a few days before you’re supposed to meet.<br />In the meantime, why don’t you stay here and take a brief rest from all these battles?”<br /><br />True, Melza did feel somewhat exhausted from her campaign. Intense battles awaited her once she regrouped with her teammates, and it only made sense that she rested and restored her spirits while possible. So she accepted the offer.<br /><br />“I think I’ll go swim for another round.”<br /><br />Melza stood up from the deck chair and walked towards the shore.<br />Her brief vacation was only about to begin.

But for some strange reason, Melza couldn’t help but keep Maurius by her side, at the deck chair.<br />The light glowed as if to call upon “something” within her.<br /><br />“What is this… unusual feeling?”<br /><br />However, this unrest faded within a few seconds.<br />Melza didn’t feel the need to mind Maurius anymore. It was almost as if she didn’t even remember the blade glowed.<br /><br />“Anyways… I think it’s time to go swim another round!”<br /><br />This was only the “beginning” of Melza’s vacation.

	“Ah, it feels great to be here!”<br /><br />Dressed in her swimsuit, Melza was relaxing at the beach, sprawled on a deck chair.<br />She was enjoying her first vacation in a long time at this private beach, which was actually part of a villa owned by a noble named Nomas.<br /><br />There were many days left before Melza was supposed to regroup with her party. This was the perfect time to rest and restore her spirits.<br /><br />“I think I’ll go swim for another round.”<br /><br />Melza stood up from the deck chair and walked towards the shore.<br />At that moment, she felt a dim, glowing light.<br /><br />“Huh?” <br /><br />That light was coming from Spirit Blade Maurius.<br />During her stay at the villa, Melza left most of her belongings in her room.

It was almost as if she didn’t even remember the blade glowed.<br /><br />“Well… I think it’s time to go swim for another…”<br /><br />Just as Melza was about to walk off, the light from Maurius intensified and drowned the entire surroundings in its glare. Within the shining light, Melza felt a strong impact shaking her consciousness.<br />The next moment, past memories of how she spent her “vacation” at the villa flowed into her mind. The enlightened Melza recalled herself spending time at this villa and this beach, no less than 17 times.

	<h4>End of Vacation</h4>

	When Melza got back to the villa, Nomas was still acting relaxed at the parlor. For a second, he was surprised by the grim expression on Melza, but he quickly realized what was happening.<br /><br />“Who really are you? What do you want?”<br /><br />Answering her question, Nomas revealed that he’s a sorcerer working as a follower of the God of Ruin. He had created a whirlpool of time, a magic barrier that weakened the ones trapped within.<br />This magic barrier had often been used as a way to defeat powerful enemies of the God of Ruin’s followers.<br /><br />“I was hoping to have you spend more time here, and rip all the power from you… Nevertheless, after 17 times in repeat, you probably don’t have much left anyways. All I have to do now, is finish the job myself!”<br /><br />After saying it, Nomas began attacking Melza with his spells.<br />In her normal state, Melza would have easily gained the upper hand. However, due to losing a large portion of her power to the magic barrier, Melza had a difficult time controlling her own movement, never mind battling.<br /><br />“Kuh…! Please, Maurius. Grant me strength and courage!”<br /><br />Maurius responded to her call, and blazed with a flash of light. Its dazzling flash forced Nomas to cover his eyes, creating the moment of chance Melza needed.<br />Melza swung the blade with what remaining powers she had, and managed to defeat Nomas.<br /><br />After Nomas was defeated, the extravagant villa suddenly turned into a derelict building. Although surprised by the sight, Melza also sensed the presence of people nearby, to which she responded by turning around with caution.<br />Standing there was her teammates, the Swordsman of Fire and the Knight of Ice. Apparently, the two were also trapped in Nomas’s magic barrier after being invited, and were just about to confront Nomas in a battle.<br />When they learned they had fell into the same trap, and battled the same enemy at the same time, the three couldn’t help burst into laughter.<br />With the incident over, the party restarted their quest to defeat the God of Ruin, leaving behind the derelict building and the nonexistent beach.<br /><br />Melza and her party’s long and abrupt vacation was finally coming to an end.<br /><br />“Hehe… I know it’s a trap, but a ‘neverending vacation’ wasn’t all that bad, was it?”
