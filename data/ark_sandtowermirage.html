	<h4>The Mystery Tower</h4>
	<strong>Unlock at Lv2</strong>
	<br /><br />
	The pen is mightier than the sword for those who wish to reveal the truth. In my life thus far, I have reported many events and incidents and broadcast my findings to the world.<br />If I do say so myself, I believe that my work has shown people new truths and given them strength to carry on.<br />I am certain that this report too will bring many people a greater appreciation of world events and deepen their knowledge.<br /><br />First, let me tell you that at the root of my actions is always a desire to broaden my own outlook in new and enlightening way. Now, the subject of this investigation is a tower that stands in the Dara Desert.<br />Although, having said that, it is unclear as to where exactly this tower can be found. This ambiguity is not due to a lack of journalistic effort on my part, but rather rumors that have gained a life of their own. No one has a clear grasp of where this tower is.<br />So, how could rumors of this tower have come into existence without anyone knowing where it is located, or indeed whether it exists at all?<br />It is undoubtedly because talk of this tower captured people’s fancy.<br />Thus, first I must reveal these rumors. When I arrive at the truth of the matter, perhaps I will again play a part in the dissemination of new knowledge to the masses.<br /><br />In my research, I was able to interview a traveler and a scholar who had encountered the tower. However, it took a lot for me to convince them to speak of it.<br />The two were initially quite wary when I approached them for an interview. The information they have must be extremely valuable if they are this concerned about not sharing it.<br />I cannot wait to hear what they have to say.<br />As I proceed in this investigation, I think I shall give this tower a name that encompasses everything it is to me: a hollow existence as yet unseen, unnamed, and unknown.<br />I will call it the “Mirage of the Tower in the Sands”.<br /><br />–Excerpt from the author’s monologue in “Tales of Granzelia”

	<h4>A Trusted Friend's Whereabouts</h4>

	At first it was an uneventful journey. I walked across the sands of the Dara Desert together with my companion.<br />Of course, the area is famed for its harsh conditions, but it wasn’t the first time for either of us. As usual, we simply walked toward the port, being mindful of our energy reserves and our direction.<br />However, disaster struck along the way, and we were caught up in a sandstorm. My friend injured his leg. Supporting his weight, I tried to push on through the gale, but could see no end to the swirling sands.<br /><br />Eventually, my friend’s injury worsened, until he could no longer walk at all. I was trying to figure out a way to create a shelter from the things we had on hands, when my friend suddenly muttered, “Is that a tower I see before me? We can rest there.”<br />The sandstorm was so severe that I couldn’t see my hand in front of my face. And besides, there was no way a tower stood there in the middle of the desert. Naturally, I did not see one, and I thought my friend must be hallucinating in his weakened state.<br />But he seemed to be seeing something and, despite his injury, he suddenly started to walk forward, staring at a fixed point ahead. Then he said to me, “Come on, let’s go.”<br /><br />I approached him to attempt to calm him down, but the next instant, he was suddenly gone.<br />I’m not kidding. It wasn’t like there was a cliff ahead that he had fallen off, nor had I lost sight of him in the sandstorm. He was just suddenly gone, as though something had swallowed him out of existence.<br /><br />– Excerpt from the traveler’s testimony in “Tales of Granzelia”

	Like you, I too once gathered together testimonials of the tower. Then, using those records, I came to a hypothesis.<br />Firstly, let me say this: that the tower was not built in a particular spot int he desert, but rather it moves around in the sandstorms to appear before travelers.<br />I was familiar with the desert myself, and this theory was based on reports that anyone who claimed to see the tower would disappear the moment they spoke of it.<br />The places within the desert where the phenomenon had occurred were too disparate, so this was the only logical conclusion.<br /><br />But if that were the case, then another question arose in my mind: where would the tower be until it appeared before someone?<br />In order to find the answer, I put together a survey team and we set out into the desert. To get the best possible results, I was very particular about matching the circumstances of those we had interviewed, and so chose a day of severe sandstorms for our expedition.<br />And then I saw it.<br />Not the tower, but the disappearance of one of my team members, right after they had declared they saw the tower in the storm.<br /><br />I felt an invisible presence drawing closer and heard a horrible scraping sound. At the same time, I had not the wherewithal to continue the investigation and ascertain the source of the sound. My entire being was consumed with the desire to flee.<br />I don’t remember how I got home.<br />The only thing I do remember is the sound of screams, mingled with the noise of something pursuing me.<br />I believe, without a doubt, that those screams were the death throes of the poor souls trapped by the tower.<br /><br />The tower exists. But it cannot be seen by the living. When you see it, you’re already dead.<br />I won’t say anything more, except that it is better to live on in ignorance, never laying eyes on the thing.<br />You should not involve yourself any further.<br /><br />– Excerpt from the scholar’s studies in “Tales of Granzelia”

	<h4>Soul Search</h4>
	<strong>Unlock at Lv10</strong>
	<br /><br />
	I am currently on my way back to my hometown. My investigation into the Mirage of the Tower in the Sands has concluded with the scholar’s interview, although I cannot say there is any real closure.<br />I have secured enough testimony to verify the existence of the tower, and my eyes have been opened to its fearsome power. Now all that is left is to collate the data and present my findings in the usual manner, and then this investigation will go down as another success.<br /><br />However… I have never before heard of a building that devours people’s souls. If such a thing does indeed exist, then it must be some kind of a spirit from another world – the world of the dead.<br />Of course, I am not dead, nor do I have any desire to die in order to verify it, so this will remain in the realm of speculation for eternity.<br />In this particular case, I have decided not to try and investigate the actual site for myself. Although it is important information, and I will report on the tower as a warning to others, I am not compelled to attempt to find proof at the expense of my own life.<br /><br />Thus, I denied my foolish adventurous spirit and chose a time when there would be no sandstorms to make the necessary trip through the desert to my hometown.<br />So why… why is there a sandstorm?<br />I must not panic.<br />The scholar was able to escape unscathed from the sandstorm and the tower.<br /><br /><br />Oh, no.<br />I have just remembered that he heard the sound, but he had not seen the tower.<br />Yet right now, I can see the tower before me…<br /><br />– Excerpt from the author’s monologue in “Tales of Granzelia”<br />These writings were found in the desert by a scholar. No official findings were ever published by the original reporter.
