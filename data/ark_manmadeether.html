	<h4>What is Ether?</h4>
	<strong>Unlock at Lv2</strong>
	<br /><br />
	Ether: the life energy all people are born with, and the source of their magical power.<br /><br />Although everyone is born with Ether, the quantity they’re born with is by no means equal. Some are born with a great amount, while others barely have any. A person’s Ether most obviously affects their magical performance, but those gifted with much of it are often accomplished in unrelated fields.<br /><br />One example is Cygnus Ralda, who was rumored to embody an extraordinary quantity of ether. Cygnus was entrusted with administering the capital by Soleil, leader of the independence army.<br /><br />At the time, Aldana had just won its independence from the Holy Kingdom Odal, and there was no clear division between administrative and legal duties. That meant that Cygnus had to oversee everything. Faced with an immense workload, his assistants were forced to alternate out due to exhaustion; but during his decade-long tenure, Cygnus himself fulfilled all his duties impeccably without ever stopping to rest. Legend also has it that Cygnus presided over more than 10 court cases per day, handing out judgments that all involved could agree were fair. Such stories are still often talked about in Aldanian legal circles to this very day.<br /><br />“The measure of the man is how his Ether measures.” These words can on one level be dismissed as a crude stereotype; at the same time, it is an incontrovertible fact that many well-known historical figures and heroes like Cygnus were Ether-gifted. But despite the large part it plays in our daily life, we know very little about Ether. One hypothesis, made by Professor Derzem of the Imperial Institute, suggested that it could be possible for man to create Ether:<br /><br />“The energy within us – typically referred to as Ether – can manifest itself in the form of magic. Would it be possible to extract Ether from the human body through reverse engineering? With more research, might Ether not be produced artificially?”

	<h4>Context of the Research</h4>
	<strong>Unlock at Lv4</strong>
	<br /><br />
	When Professor Derzem published his thesis, academic circles generally regarded it as unchecked fantasy – or at best idle speculation. Given that Ether was still shrouded in mysteries, this may have been a natural enough reaction.<br /><br />Professor Derzem and a number of his colleagues however, never doubted that Ether could be manufactured. Backed by a number of investors, Derzem and associates established their own laboratory, the first objective of which was to extract and preserve Ether from the human body – certainly a difficult proposition as the substance has no physical form.<br />However, this was seen as an indispensable step in analyzing the composition of Ether.<br /><br />Offered moderate compensation, a group of indigent test subjects volunteered for the experiments, which began soon afterward. Researchers were able to extract Ether from them with astonishing ease, instantly vindicating Derzem’s theory about reverse engineering magic. Interestingly enough, the researchers’ greatest difficulty lay in teaching the test subjects how to use magic. Propelled onward by their successful short-term preservation of Ether, the scientists attempted to manufacture it from scratch.<br /><br />That was when Derzem and associates came face to face with the real challenge. Although they had seemingly done the impossible by producing artificial Ether, it was useless for casting spells, even with the aid of magical artifacts. Its composition seemed identical to Ether extracted from the human body, so what exactly was missing? Troubled by this question, Professor Derzem would go on to conduct many experiments, each and every one of which resulted in failure. As success continued to prove elusive, many researchers left the laboratory, while the rest were never sure when their funding might dry up.<br /><br />Those circumstances are likely responsible for the tragedy that would ensue…

	<h4>The Explosion</h4>
	<strong>Unlock at Lv7</strong>
	<br /><br />
	A tragedy occurred at the Ether laboratory when a research project failed, rocking the facility with a massive explosion. The entire lab was blown to pieces, and some reports stated that the blast was audible as distant as the Imperial Capital. According to the Aldanian Knights who investigated, a massive effusion of Ether during one of Professor Derzem’s experiments was to blame.<br /><br />The professor was declared dead, the laboratory ravaged, and all funds withdrawn from the research. Thus research into the artificial production of Ether would come to a close.<br /><br />Interestingly enough, Professor Derzem announced on the day of the accident that he was about to conduct an innovative experiment certain to alter the course of history. Some argue that arrogance was to blame for his death; however, during the course of my private investigation, scientists stated that the experiment could not have caused the explosion.<br />Furthermore, suspicious persons were spotted near the laboratory on the day of the accident, and Ether laboratory scientists have been repeatedly blackmailed in the days since.<br /><br />Could the explosion be the work of opposing forces who intended to stop the research? As time went by, it seemed more and more so…

	<h4>Speculations and New Data</h4>
	<strong>Unlock at Lv10</strong>
	<br /><br />
	If the explosion was not a mere failure but the result of sabotage, then who perpetrated it?<br /><br />Had he successfully manufactured Ether, Professor Derzem would have been remembered as a towering historical figure. Certainly rival researchers could be considered suspects – artificial Ether would have brought fame to its creator and hitherto unforeseen prosperity to all humankind. As such it is also conceivable that the incident was orchestrated by the God of Ruin’s remaining devotees, hoping to halt humanity’s march of progress.<br /><br />But the responsible party wasn’t satisfied with simply undermining Derzem’s research, and sought instead to destroy the laboratory once and for all – suggesting that he or she was acting as part of an organization. While mulling this over I was tipped off to a major, highly secretive energy experiment planned at an Imperial facility in the West Dara Desert. Could this energy be, in truth, Ether?<br /><br />If it is, I may be able to track down those who made Professor Derzem a dead man. The veracity of the information and the location of the facility are dubious, but I feel obliged to confirm them myself. For seeking artificial ether is now my only goal in life…<br /><br />----<br /><br />These hand-written notes were discovered in the West Dara Desert alongside a half-dessicated corpse, which evidence suggests once belonged to Gardin Dawson. Dawson was the top pupil of Professor Derzem, who only survived the explosion because he was late for the experiment.<br /><br />This led him to be treated harshly by investigators, who initially saw him as a suspect. No one was sure whether survivor’s guilt or the interrogation was to blame, but Gardin became mentally unstable after the incident. His writings invite the conclusion that he was headed for an “Imperial facility”, but no such thing exists. Was he simply delusional, or did something more transpire?<br /><br />– Report on the Corpse Discovered in the West Dara Desert, by Rimmel Emerith, Imperial Patrol Knight of the Aldanian Empire
