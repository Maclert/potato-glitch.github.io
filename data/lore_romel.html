	<h4>Demon of Fire</h4>
	<strong>Unlock at Lv10</strong>
	<br /><br />
	Romel was a legendary martial artist who was often known by his nickname: "God of War".<br />Yet despite his prowess, there were also many accounts of wrongdoing committed by him. His place of birth has always been shrouded in mystery.<br />Some have theorized based on various writings left behind by Romel that he was born on the continent of Mordana, though such theories are impossible to confirm. For this reason, the circumstances under which he grew up remain shrouded in mystery.<br />However, based on his bare-fist fighting style, some have speculated that he had studied at either a dojo specializing in martial arts, or under a master who likely had a similar style.<br /><br />Romel's name first made its appearance in the historical record due to a confrontation which occurred between him and a flame demon in the Malboria Lava Caves. Having defeated a number of weaker warriors in combat on the continent of Mordana, Romel sought a confrontation with someone, or something, with a power equal to his own.<br />It was then that he heard rumors of a flame demon of terrible power which resided within the Malboria Lava Caves on the continent of Aldana.<br /><br />"Huh, a demon... Might be interesting."<br /><br />Having decided upon the demon as his next opponent, Romel made his way quickly to the continent of Aldana where he began exploring the Malboria Lava Caves. As their name suggested, the caves were an inhospitable, scorched area replete with swirling magma flows, but Romel was known for his resilience to heat and he was soon able to locate his quarry.<br />The battle is said to have bene so intense it left an indelible mark on the features of the surrounding mountain peaks, but unfortunately the inhospitable nature of the terrain meant that there were no onlookers to witness exactly what transpired.<br /><br />There are various theories as to who won and who lost the battle, with some claiming Romel won, and some claiming that the fight was called off due to some kind of accident. Sightings of the flame demon have been confirmed since Romel's battle reportedly took place, adding an extra layer of confusion to the whole story.<br /><br />However, none of the various theories which were put forward suggested that Romel was defeated, and it remains a common perception among the locals that "Romel never tasted defeat at the hands of the flame demon".

	<h4>At the Arena</h4>
	<strong>Unlock at Lv30</strong>
	<br /><br />
	After his purported fight with the flame demon, Romel remained out of public sight for some time before he was once again spotted at the Aldana Arena.<br /><br />At the time, the Aldana Arena was a popular destination for skilled swordsmen who had escaped a life of gladiatorial combat and sought to test their mettle. The quality of the warriors who frequented the arena was the highest it had ever been and the area had become well known as a gathering place for the crème de la crème of Granzelia's warrior class.<br /><br />It was an ideal place for one such as Romel and he attended many a battle in the area with glee. Shortly after his first appearance, Romel became famous for achieving 10 consecutive victories, an impressive feat at the time. The arena's audience went crazy for their new favorite warrior.<br />It later came to pass that Romel was scheduled to spar against one of the arena's most famous female fighters, Ignis, and the battle was naturally expected to be a magnificent spectacle. What happened next was rather unexpected...<br /><br />"Wh-what do you mean a woman...!?"<br /><br />Romel's performance during the fight was almost unrecognizably poor and he was defeated by Ignis with surprising ease. Many were suspicious of Romel's lackluster performance, with some even suggesting that he threw the fight intentionally.<br /><br />However, it later came to light that Romel dealt poorly with women, and it is now believed that his defeat was due at least in part to his own quirk. Having been thoroughly embarassed by a battle held in an arena that accepted female contestants, Romel never returned to the arena after his defeat.

	<h4>A Feast</h4>
	<strong>Unlock at Lv50</strong>
	<br /><br />
	At last the battle between the God of Ruin and humanity was at hand.<br />The battle was to be humanity's last stand against the dominion of the God of Ruin and grew to envelop all of Granzelia, but for his part Romel was not particularly concerned with the God of Ruin's world domination or independence of humanity.<br /><br />Despite his earlier humiliation, Romel became greatly interested in the battle between humanity and the agents of the God of Ruin which was now engulfing every corner of the land, and he was delighted to join the fray. However, Romel did not fight on the side of humanity nor did he throw his support behind the God of Ruin. He made no distinction between those who fought for humanity, and those who fought for the God of Ruin, preferring instead to lend his power to whichever side appeared to be at a disadvantage.<br /><br />"Bwahaha... It's like being in the middle of a huge festival. Given how much fun everyone's having, don't mind if I dip my toes in..."<br /><br />Then as if trying to exhibit his own strength on the battlefield, Romel acted as though he might turn the tide of battle all by himself. It goes without saying that Romel's behavior cast the forces of each country into confusion and chaos. Although he made no significant impact on battle as a whole, one soldier hailing from Mordana is reported to have remarked that "dealing with just that one bastard Romel is worse than engaging the worst enemy!"<br /><br />Clearly there was no love lost between Romel and the armies of mankind. Naturally, Romel became a target for both the human forces as well as the agents of the God of Ruin.<br />However, Romel was greatly pleased to have at his disposal such a strong lineup of opponents who were eager to engage him in combat.

	<h4>Departing God</h4>
	<strong>Unlock at Lv80</strong>
	<br /><br />
	After the conclusion of the battle with the God of Ruin, the nations which had participated announced a bounty on Romel's head. Romel was hated by soldiers on all sides due to his frequent attacks, which were levied not only at the God of Ruin's forces, but those of the humans as well.<br />Romel is said to have been entirely unmoved by this new development, and instead decided to continue traveling the world in search of formidable opponents. Of course, he was accosted by many a bounty hunter looking for an easy reward, but none proved to be worthy opponents. In addition to the occasional skirmish with bounty hunters, the battles which Romel encountered on his journeys left him feeling unfulfilled and depressed.<br /><br />"Good grief. Why is it I always run into such weaklings? It's all such a bore..."<br /><br />A great many powerful warriors had already either lost their lives to the recent war, or became lost in its wake, leading to a dearth of opponents capable of satisfying Romel in Granzelia.<br />After traveling through many lands exotic and mundane, Romel returned to the Malboria Lava Caves where he had once done battle with the flame demon. It would be the last anyone heard of him.<br />Furthermore, records indicate that the volcano erupted a short time after Romel entered the caves. Most believe that Romel died in the eruption, but there are also those who have put forward different theories.<br />One such theory posits that Romel, along with the flame demon, opened a portal to another world near the mouth of the volcano. According to the theory, the eruption was caused by vibrations which occurred during the opening of the portal as the two combatants sought a new venue for their sparring in another world.
