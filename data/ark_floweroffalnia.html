	<h4>The Miracle Flower</h4>
	<strong>Unlock at Lv2</strong>
	<br /><br />
	Somewhere in Granzelia, there is a flower that can cure any illness and heal any wound.<br />It is called the Flower of Falnia, and it grows only on the craggy rocks along the seashore. The flower blooms just once every ten years on the night of a full moon. It is said that the moment the flower opens, it release a unique substance with the power to heal any sickness.<br />There are various rumors on the exact source of this power. Perhaps it is contained in the light emitted by the flower when illuminated by the moon, or in the nutrients of its stalk.<br /><br />The flower remains open for just one night, and by morning, having reached the end of its lifespan, it will wither and die. According to legend, a goddess once grew jealous of the flower’s beauty and sought to prevent it from blooming ever again. But a god who served her took pity on the pretty flower, and secretly cast a spell on it so that it would bloom but once every ten years.<br />This is of course merely a legend, and its truth has not been verified.<br /><br />A miracle that occurs but once every ten years…<br />There are many records of people who have sought the flower, pinning all their hopes on that one miraculous moment. Some wished to save the lives of their loved ones, while others were trying to protect the bonds they held dear.<br />Others still sought to use it for their own ends, or to study it for posterity.<br />While their goals were all different, what bound them together was their fascination with the mysterious power of the flower and the way they dedicated everything they had to finding it.<br />I will now tell several of their stories.

	<h4>The Boy and the Sage</h4>
	<strong>Unlock at Lv4</strong>
	<br /><br />
	Long ago, a sage traveled around the lands on an ascetic journey. He preached about the creation of the world at the hands of the gods, and how this knowledge could offer humankind a path to happiness.<br />Devout believers of his teachings supported his journey.<br /><br />During his travels, he stopped by a poor village, where he met with a young boy who was suffering from an illness of unknown origin. The boy was dying and had little time left.<br />The sage tried to save the boy through doctrine, but it proved to be ineffective against the disease. While the sage was confident that his teachings had saved the souls of many thus far, he now fell into despair at his own powerlessness.<br /><br />Desperate to save the boy at any cost, he worked day and night to find a way to cure his ailment. Then, he heard rumors of a flower that bloomed but once every ten years on the night of a full moon, and could cure any illness.<br />Ascertaining that the flower would bloom that very night, the sage dragged his fatigued body out and searched far and wide for it.<br />Then, just before sunset, he found it atop a cliff, and settled down to wait.<br /><br />At last, the full moon rose above the plant and the flower began to glow under its silvery light. After a while, the flower bloomed spectacularly with a light more brilliant than even the moon itself.<br />Not about to let this chance slip by, the sage sealed the light that fell from the flower’s petals into a container he had brought and took it back to the boy.<br />When the sage opened the container before the boy, his sick body absorbed the light of the bloom, and he was immediately cured.

	<h4>Flowery Choice</h4>
	<strong>Unlock at Lv7</strong>
	<br /><br />
	Once, a woman searched for a flower that was rumored to cure any illness.<br />She wished to cure her daughter, the only family she had.<br />The woman had raised her daughter all by herself, but it was not an easy life, and she lacked the means to provide proper care and medicine for her sick child.<br /><br />After many years of struggle and effort, she finally found the flower. However, the king of the land suddenly appeared and used his authority to threaten her into handing the flower over to him.<br />The king wanted the flower for himself because he had sprained his ankle that morning, and wished to heal it immediately in order to attend a ball that same night. To the mother, this was no good reason for her to hand over the flower.<br /><br />She pleaded that if he was going to use the flower’s power for himself that he at least provide her the means to seek treatment for her daughter.<br />But the king was not the type to listen to the pleas of poor, lowly commoners. Not wanting to share the flower with anyone else, he tried to forcefully drag the woman away from where it grew.<br />As they struggled, the full moon rose and the flower began to emit its light.<br /><br />Light flowed from the petals and streamed straight past the king, and his men even as they tried to capture it, making its way straight toward the town where the woman lived.<br />The mother hurried back home to find her beloved daughter waiting for her, hale and healthy.<br />Seeing the warm bond of love between mother and child, the king was ashamed, and from then on he became a good ruler who listened to the common people of his kingdom.<br />It seems that the flower has a will of its own in choosing who will receive the benefits of its healing power.

	<h4>Persistent Research</h4>
	<strong>Unlock at Lv10</strong>
	<br /><br />
	The Flower of Falnia does not bloom outside of that single night in a ten-year period.<br />Due to the length of time between its blooms, even those who desire to research it have been unable to analyze it properly. While it has piqued the curiosity of scholars, it has also caused them many headaches.<br />Even when the flower blooms, it leaves but a few hours in which to examine it, and repeating the same step every ten years is a mind-numbingly drawn-out and repetitive process.<br />Still, there was once a scholar who attempted it.<br /><br />Since that scholar left only records on the ecology of the flower, details on the exact location of its habitat have been lost to us. The scholar writes that in order to make the ten-year cycle more bearable, he first attempted to bring the flower into his own laboratory.<br />However, when he tried to take it with him, the plant immediately started to wilt, so the scholar hurriedly returned it to its original location.<br /><br />While there are exceptions, it seems that people who wanted to save the bedridden sick and injured, generally captured the flower’s glowing light and brought it back with them.<br />Incidentally, the scholar wrote that trying to bring the flower home with him was one of his greatest mistakes, and he regretted it deeply. But thankfully, ten years later, he visited the spot where he had replanted the flower and found that it bloomed as usual.<br /><br />This time, since he could not take the flower, he instead took back some of the nearby dirt to analyze and see if he could identify the secrets of its healing powers from the soil.<br />As he was collecting it, he perceived a magical response from the dirt. However, upon bringing it back to his lab and checking the readings, the levels of magic had changed and he could detect nothing out of the ordinary.<br />It is still unknown as to whether this was caused by a deterioration of the magic within the dirt, or whether the magic originally detected had been diffused by the flower itself into the surrounding soil.
