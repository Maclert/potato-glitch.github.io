	<h4>Origin</h4>
	<strong>Unlock at Lv2</strong>
	<br /><br />
	The first person in Granzelia to successfully create a golem was the ancient sorcerer Tarrid.<br />With then-peerless wizarding skill befitting one of the Ten Masters, he created a golem to help organize the mountains of paperwork littering his laboratory.<br />The golem he created was a simple being made of stone; it could only follow basic instructions and stay active for an hour or so. It was a rather low-level creation by the standards of today’s magic, but at the time, the idea of a puppet that could work independently from its master was quite innovative.<br /><br />Yet in the centuries that followed, there were few major advancements in golem technology beyond material makeup. There are many reasons for this stagnation, but the primary cause was the simple lack of demand.<br />Making a golem required the power of a sorcerer, who were far outside the price range of an average user. And as stated above, golems at the time had quite limited functionality.<br />Golems could only be thrown at construction or battle, and to the people in power, it was far more efficient to hire mercenaries or salves to do that than it would have been to enlist an expensive sorcerer.<br />As such, golems remained a curiosity, an underwhelming companion of luxurious price that only a select few sorcerers could even produce.<br /><br />That is, until the Arcane Associates of Alcheos formed in Mordana. This association would go on to invent revolutionary techniques that changed the way the world saw golems forever.

	<h4>The Arcane Associates of Alcheos</h4>
	<strong>Unlock at Lv4</strong>
	<br /><br />
	The Arcane Associates of Alcheos was created around the beginning of the God of Ruin’s reign over Granzelia. When it was formed, it was no different to any other alliance of sorcerers.<br />Records indicate that they began to specialize in golem manufacturing after someone experienced in golems joined the group. However, demand for golems was still scarce, so they merely fulfilled the occasional order.<br /><br />Given this history, there are few scholars who would conclude that Alcheos’ beginnings laid any foundations for the technological revolution that was to come. But no scholar can deny that the man who brought about that revolution was first given the chance to create golems in Alcheos.<br />When this man, the sorcerer Leadan, entered the alliance, the world was starting to change.<br />People were growing fed up living under the tyranny of the God of Ruin.

	<h4>The Golem Core Project</h4>
	<strong>Unlock at Lv7</strong>
	<br /><br />
	When the sorcerer Leaden joined the Arcane Associates of Alcheos, he was a specialist in magical medicine and had never touched golem crafting.<br />Once he did, he became enamored with the subject and researched it with vigor. His first area of study was the golems’ internal magical circuitry. Until that point, golems required magical injections that were evenly distributed across their entire body, in order to move. But Leaden wondered if concentrating that magical energy in a core could drastically increase a golem’s horsepower, operational duration, and processing ability.<br /><br />He set to work at once, but he quickly ran into the hurdle of finding an appropriate material for storing this energy.<br />The crystals frequently used for magical experiments were brittle and not suited to something that moved independently. Crystals found in nature were more durable, but unable to store the amount of magic needed to power a golem for very long.<br />He went on to test many substances and experience many failures. The material he finally landed upon was kept a secret within the Association and remains a mystery to this day. It’s said that he used a relic from an ancient civilization.<br /><br />After three years of research, Leaden finally completed what would later be known as the Golem Core.<br />Golems equipped with this core performed even better than Leaden had anticipated. Horsepower, operational duration, processing ability, and autonomy… in every category, the new golems outclassed all that had come before, and were well-equipped to change the world.

	<h4>Prosperity and Ruin</h4>
	<strong>Unlock at Lv10</strong>
	<br /><br />
	With the completion of the Golem Core, golem manufacturing quickly became the primary revenue stream for the Arcane Associates of Alcheos.<br />Leadan was given the reins of the Association and pushed it to specialize in golem production.<br />He announced new golem models and new weaponry based on golem technology one after the other.<br />"Golem Engineer Leadan" became a household name as he brought Alcheos into its Golden Age.<br /><br />But this age didn't last long.<br />During an experiment, a freak accident occurred which took Leadan's life.<br />After that, the Association shifted its stance once again.<br />It stopped announcing new Golem Core technologies to the entire world and instead kept its techniques veiled in secrecy.<br />Then, the Association started refusing all golem orders from traders and governments while its sorcerers hid themselves away in the factory to focus on development.<br />It's unknown as to why the Association changed course, but some have theorized that a much larger organization may have sent them a massive order with an appropriately large sum of money.<br /><br />Unfortunately, this is where the history of the Arcane Associates of Alcheos abruptly ends.<br />Followers of the God of Ruin, declaring the Association to be heretical, attacked the factory.<br />They tore the facility to the ground.<br />The engineers and sorcerers tasked with crafting golems had no way to oppose them, and many were executed on the spot.<br />A few were supposedly able to use golems to escape the assault, but their details are unknown.<br />It's been suggested that there were golem specialists who searched the world for those runaways, but even less is known about them.<br /><br />After the fall of Alcheos, Golem Core technology was sealed by the God of Ruin's followers as a forbidden technology.<br />Mankind has yet to find that sealed area even after escaping the God of Ruin's rule, so golems remain a lost technology.
