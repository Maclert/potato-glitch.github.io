	<h4>The Sorcerous City</h4>
	<strong>Unlock at Lv2</strong>
	<br /><br />
	Since time immemorial, Granzelia has had a legend of a city floating in the sky.<br />The city’s name was Sorcerer’s Eden.<br />However, according to legend, it was not always floating in the sky, but rather began as a grounded city. It all started when Rynolph the Sorcerer founded a city for, and by sorcerers, so he could fully immerse himself in his research.<br />Rynolph was a wise man known not only for his magical power, but for his wisdom as well, and thus he would often be invited to various countries.<br />However, these visits were quite time-consuming, and he began to stress over the lack of progress in his research. He planned to free himself of the affairs of other nations by founding a city solely for sorcerers.<br /><br />Working out the project details with his disciples, Rynolph decided to establish his city somewhere that others would not dare visit. At first, the only ones who gathered there were Rynolph, his disciples, and his friends. At this point, it would be more accurate to call it a village, rather than a city.<br />But eventually word spread, and as more sorcerers came to visit, more decided to settle there, and in a few decades, the village developed into a cutting-edge city for sorcery.<br />However, as the city prospered, it also gained notoriety. Many nations surrounding the city began secretly plotting to use the power of the sorcerers for themselves, or to eliminate the sorcerers before they became too big of a threat.<br />Concerned about the threat of interference, exploitation, and invasion, Rynolph made a decision.

	One night, a tremendous tremor and a thunderous roar could be felt coming from Sorcerer’s Eden. Those living nearby went to go see what the ruckus was about, only to be greeted by an astonishing sight.<br />Sorcerer’s Eden in its entirety was gone, leaving only a hole in the ground.<br />The sight bewildered the witnesses, and many began to speculate what had caused the city’s disappearance.<br />Some said that the sudden earthquake opened a rift that swallowed the city whole. Others suggested that a dangerous experiment had gone wrong, causing an explosion large enough to level the entire city.<br />But since there was no evidence to support either theory, nobody could come to a consensus.<br /><br />Once the initial theories began to die out, a new theory was born:<br />In another attempt to escape society, Rynolph had lifted his city up by its roots, and sent it floating into the sky.<br />There was no evidence for this theory either, but it stood out in that many self-proclaimed witnesses began to claim that they had seen a city resembling Sorcerer’s Eden floating between the clouds.<br />Afterward, people began looking to the skies, searching for Sorcerer’s Eden, but through the long course of history, only a handful of people have purportedly seen it.<br />Eventually, Sorcerer’s Eden became known as a phantom city floating in the sky.

	“You know, at first I thought it was a weird cloud. But the more I looked at it, the more I realized it wasn’t a cloud at all. It was a bunch of buildings. And the longer I stared at it, the more I realized, hey, it could be that city of sorcerers.<br />How could I tell?<br />I’ve been inside that city once before to deliver a package. Man, it was such an amazing, wondrous place. Unlike anything I’ve ever seen. <br />I don’t know a thing about magic, so everything I saw was shocking. Ground that moved, crystals that lit up rooms, you name it.<br /><br />The most impressive thing though, were these giant stone statues that carried packages. One of those things just appeared behind me without a sound, and I was so surprised I nearly fell backwards.<br />Hm?<br />Oh, how did I know it was Sorcerer’s Eden?<br />On the top of the tallest tower in that city is a crystal, see?<br />That’s what made me sure, without a doubt, that it was that same city that I saw. But when I tried looking one more time, it slipped back into the clouds.<br />And I was the only one who saw it then, so every single one of my friends say that I was just seeing things.<br />But I know what I saw… Not that I’ve got any proof.”<br /><br />This testimony came from a young man living in a nearby farm town. He was just one person who claimed to have seen Sorcerer’s Eden between the clouds.<br />The young man had delivered produce to Sorcerer’s Eden before the city’s disappearance.

	“How long has it been since I began searching for the lost city of Sorcerer’s Eden?<br />I’ve yet to find a single hint or trace of its existence. Not to mention the tank’s running dangerously low. If I don’t find somewhere to refuel soon… Maybe I should just give up this wild goose chase?<br />No, I can’t quit now.<br />I’ve loved the stories, loved the very idea of Sorcerer’s Eden since I was young. There’s no way I can just give up so easily. It’s my destiny… Heaven decrees I should find this lost city in the sky.<br />Divine intervention guided me to this skyship while exploring those ruins, after all.<br />I must find it, no matter how long it takes…<br /><br />But I’ve been searching so long, where in these confounded skies could it possibly be hiding? I’m beginning to suspect it might no longer even exist int his world.<br />There’s talk of another world beyond Granzelia. Perhaps Sorcerer’s Eden has slipped into this other world…?<br />No, surely I’m just jumping to conclusions. After all, there’s still plenty of sky left to search in this world.”<br /><br />– A note salvaged from the wreckage of a small skyship found in the Dara Desert. The ship is believed to have crashed. The sun-bleached skeletal remains of its pilot were found nearby.
