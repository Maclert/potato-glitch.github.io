	<br /><br />
	There exists an old children’s story that is widely popular on the Odal continent.<br />The story is called “The Witch’s House”.<br />It tells of an old witch living in a forest who uses her magic to help the local village children with various matters.<br />The story was an instant hit upon publication and continues to be widely read and beloved by children to this day. “The Witch’s House” helped increase the popularity of spells and inspired many children who read it, to become magicians when they came of age.<br />Beyond being a story about solving problems with magic, it also provides useful ways to look at the world and distinguish good from evil, as well as instill ethics and morals in a way that is easy for children to grasp.<br />For this reason, it still remains a highly valued literary work.<br /><br />“The Witch’s House” was written by a woman from the Samel Village named Sarea.<br />It was the only book she ever wrote in her life.

	The old witch Lleva listened carefully to my story and said this:<br />“Hoho… So your father won’t wake from his slumber, will he? That’s probably the doing of the Dream Eater.”<br />I repeated the name, confused. “The Dream Eater?”<br />“Yes, that’s right. It’s a spirit that enters dreams and turns them into nightmares. To wake your father, you must enter his dream and exterminate the Dream Eater.”<br />I looked at Lleva doubtfully, rather appalled at what she was suggesting.<br />“But before that, a question: Has your father had any worries lately?”<br />“Worries?”<br />“Well, perhaps it would be faster to just enter his dream and figure things out from there.”<br />Lleva slowly rose from her chair.<br />“Shall we get going?”<br />“Going… where?”<br />“To your house, silly. You want to awaken your father, don’t you?”<br />“Yeah, okay. But I don’t know if my father had any worries. He didn’t seem to be stressed about anything in particular.”<br />“Well, I doubt he’d want to show his weak side to his daughter.”<br />Lleva frowned from a second before her face returned to its usual expression.<br />“Just keep in mind that your father’s still human. As a child, you might think adults are strong, but we still worry sometimes.<br />Adults are just children with longer arms, longer legs, and a longer list of privileges and responsibilities.<br />That’s something you don’t seem to understand.”<br /><br />I didn’t know how to respond to the witch’s words.<br />Lleva let out a strange laugh when she saw my hesitation. “At my age, you and your father both look like little babies to me. Hyuck hyuck hyuck!”<br /><br />– Excerpt from “The Witch’s House”, Chapter 4: “Dream Eater”

	<h4>The Horned Beast</h4>

	On the other side of the fence surrounding the village, I saw a giant horned Beast.<br />It probably wanted to attack us.<br />It made me shiver just thinking about it. But Lleva just put a hand on my shoulder and let out a chuckle.<br />“Now, now, there’s no need to worry.”<br />She then lifted up her cane. Miraculously, the Beast stopped in its tracks.<br />It looked around blankly, turned completely around, and then walked off in the opposite direction.<br />“What was that?” the astonished village chief asked the witch.<br />“I cast a spell on it to sap it of its fighting spirit. It doesn’t seem like its territory is nearby, but rather it simply wandered here by chance. I don’t think we’ll have to worry about it attacking this village anymore.”<br />“In that case, maybe we should take it down while we’ve got the chance.”<br />“You sure are a stubborn one. That living creature just wants the food it needs to survive. Of course, WE don’t have to be on the menu!” Lleva snorted. “It’ll probably look for food in the Badar Sea of Trees. If it finds a meal, it will survive. If it starves to death, that’s just the circle of life. Either way, it’s no longer a threat, so what do you care?”<br /><br />– Excerpt from “The Witch’s House”, Chapter 8: “The Horned Beast”

	<h4>The Real Witch</h4>

	Until now, it was assumed that “The Witch’s House” was an entirely fictional story borne from the imagination of its author, Sarea.<br />But there was still one mystery surrounding its creation: how could Sarea, who had basically no knowledge of the magical arts, create such elaborate descriptions of sorcery in her work?<br />According to recent research, actual people and events formed the basis of her fairy tale.<br /><br />This new evidence surfaced when a drafted afterword that was never published in “The Witch’s House” was discovered in Sarea’s desk.<br />It is reproduced here:<br /><br />“The Witch’s House is based on memories from my childhood. In the village where I grew up, there lived a witch very much like Lleva from this story. The witch would act put-upon when receiving requests from troubled villagers, but she would never fail to offer them a helping hand.<br />Now the witch is no longer living there, having set out on a journey to some unknown destination. Still, I will always treasure the days I spent with her and the things I learned.”<br /><br />It is unclear why Sarea did not include this afterword in her book. Perhaps she originally intended to, but changed her mind prior to publishing and decided to keep the person who served as the model for Lleva a secret close to her heart.<br /><br />Incidentally, while Sarea’s home was on the outskirts of the northeastern Samel Village, the witch’s house was situated further east, halfway between the village and the Badar Sea of Trees.<br />Although the witch did not tend to associate with the villagers of Samel, for an appropriate fee she would offer them advice, elixirs, and magical talismans in times of trouble.<br />As is written in the unpublished afterword, the witch has already departed from the vicinity of Samel Village, and her house has also vanished without a trace.<br />According to the testimony of someone who was acquainted with the witch, the story was true to life in that she was of an unsympathetic disposition and disliked children. However, she seems to have had a fondness for Sarea, and never begrudged her frequent visits.
