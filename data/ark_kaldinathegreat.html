	<h4>A Divine Experiment in City Building</h4>
	<strong>Unlock at Lv2</strong>
	<br /><br />
	In the central region of the Holy Kingdom, there is a collection of ruins called the Ruins of Kaldina. These ruins are what’s left of the capital city of Kaldina, said to have once been a center of immense prosperity.<br /><br />The city was established long before the Holy Kingdom, and dates back to a time before the gods ruled the world. According to tradition, the city is said to have been crafted by an ancient god. The god is said to have had a great influence over the world, but after the advent and proto-development of humanity, the god apparently ceased to use their power directly.<br />Nevertheless, it is said that the god had a specific goal in mind when they created the city. The god sought to answer the question:<br />“How might humanity develop if they are given some measure of divine technology?”<br />At least, that is what scholars now speculate. In other words, as far as the god was concerned, Kaldina was a kind of “experiment” designed to ascertain the potential and limitations of human beings.<br /><br />Regardless, the city of Kaldina was aided and protected by the god and the city soon developed splendidly, much to the delight of its human residents. Those who worshipped the god and incorporated the god’s divine works into usable “technologies” greatly improved their standard of living.<br />The prosperity enjoyed by the denizens of the city was such that the people of Granzelia developed a saying: “Kaldina is an outpost of the Divine Realm”.

	According to the scholarly literature, the most distinctive feature of the city of Kaldina was its architecture.<br />Most of the buildings in Kaldina were said to emit such a dazzling glow in the light of day that their luster was often mistaken for that of gold. The brilliance of the city’s architecture was a product of the magic used during construction, which not only greatly improved aesthetics, but also the durability of the buildings themselves. As a result, structures built in Kaldina were of a strength incomparable to buildings built elsewhere, and it was claimed that they would not decay even in a thousand years.<br />Naturally, the magic used to achieve such feats were developed based on magic granted by the god. As an interesting aside, many outsiders who visited the city of Kaldina mistook many of the materials used in the city’s architecture for actual gold due to their splendor, and many tried to steal what they could.<br /><br />Amongst the architecture of Kaldina, the Seat of Government built in the center of the city was a particularly eye-catching specimen. The building itself was very tall, affording a complete view of the surrounding city, and it ultimately became a symbol of the great city as an exemplary collection of the best architecture techniques Kaldina had to offer.<br />A bronze statue praising the god was erected at the top of the building.<br />Those who lived in Kaldina were said to have swelled with pride for their city every time they saw the Seat of Government building, while travelers from afar were said to have been greatly impressed by its sheer enormity and splendor.

	<h4>A City of the Arcane</h4>

	Kaldina left its mark on history as a city which developed highly advanced magic technology and many institutes and schools of magic could be found throughout its many wards. It is believed that Altaga, one of the Council of Ten who are said to have laid the foundation for the development of the arcane arts, played a pivotal role in facilitating the construction of many of the houses of magical learning which dotted the city.<br />Although Altaga, who was a native of Kaldina, did not leave many achievements to posterity as an individual mage, he demonstrated tremendous talent as both a scholar and educator. He initiated reforms which completely changed the landscape of magical education. Until then, in order to master the magical arts, it was necessary to seek out a particular kind of master from whom the fundamentals of magic could be learned. However, the number of people capable of becoming such a master and the number of disciples that a given master could take in were limited and as a result only a select few who wished to learn the magical arts were actually afforded an opportunity to do so.<br />In order to overcome the above limitations, Altaga authored a textbook which neatly distilled the fundamentals needed to learn magic. A school was thereafter established based on the new textbook so that students could learn the rudiments of magic even without a dedicated master.<br /><br />Altaga’s reforms were largely panned by the other mages of the time, who placed great importance on the traditional apprenticeship system, but it greatly increased the people’s basic knowledge of the arcane arts. Thereafter, a multitude of institutions and schools of magic sprang up all over Kaldina, greatly boosting the development and research of magic. Incidentally, the pedagogical methods developed by Altaga in Kaldina still serve as the basis for many curricula used in today’s magical academies.

	<h4>Decadence and Collapse</h4>
	<strong>Unlock at Lv10</strong>
	<br /><br />
	The city of Kaldina enjoyed a period of unprecedented prosperity thanks to the favor it enjoyed by its patron god and the rapid development of the magical arts.<br />However, the city’s development inevitably led to some measure of hubris among its residents. As they became increasingly overconfident, they became more and more estranged from the god which had spurred their development. Their arrogance ultimately erupted in the form of a theory, which became popular at the time, that they people could do just fine without their God.<br /><br />The theory was initially framed with the argument that “the technologies given to us by our god should be developed by human hands without troubling those of the God’s.”<br />However, many people began to misunderstand the original motivation underlying this theory, believing that there was no longer any need to rely on the god and further development could be achieved by human hands alone. Naturally, the city government tried to stem the tide of public opinion, but unfortunately, the God learned of the city’s residents’ newfound attitude before much could be done to clamp down on this new set of poisonous ideas.<br />The God was deeply disappointed in the humans who he had helped. He spoke thusly to the people regarding the power and technology that the god had given them.<br /><br />“If you believe that you hold such power, let you use your power to overcome the hardships which I shall cause to befall you.”<br /><br />Immediately thereafter, Kaldina was battered by a multitude of hardships and plagues numbering more than one hundred. While the citizens of Kaldina succeeded in somehow overcoming the first few trials which the god set before them, the seemingly unending series of disasters and calamities could not be stemmed, and the city eventually fell into ruin.<br />Some of the populace begged the god for mercy, but the God was already deaf to their pleas and these people too were eventually swallowed up by the collapse as they were led down a path of merciless destruction.<br /><br />Now, all that remains are ruins which only hint at the prosperity the city once enjoyed. However, the descendants of some of the citizens who survived the Kaldinian apocalypse later founded a new nation, which they called “Norlean”, close to the ruins.
