	<h4>Winter Festival</h4>
	<strong>Unlock at Lv2</strong>
	<br /><br />
	When a certain period of the winter comes, families from all around the world will decorate fir trees, and saints in red clothing will come to give presents to children. Such scenery is common throughout the country when the festival known as “Christmas” comes.<br />Though it is now a commonly celebrated festival, the origin of this holiday can actually be tracked back to the age when the world was said to be ruled by the Creator.<br /><br />A long time ago, there was once an elderly priest who lived in Northern Lanzelia. After losing his children in a famine many years ago, he started to use his own church as a storage for food, which he never hesitated in giving when he sees someone in need.<br />One day, the father received news that a village on the other side of the mountain was close to hunger because of the continuous snow. The sun had long set on that day, and the snowstorm was raging outside. However, that did not stop him from loading food onto the sleigh.<br />Knowing that he is about to the depart for the village, the others around tried to stop him. The blizzard was not the only danger, as there were also rumors that two deer Beasts have been attacking townspeople and destroying crops.<br /><br />Despite the opposition, the priest spoke up.<br />“I will be going to that village, no matter what others may say. Many are waiting in hunger. I refuse to sit and wait, knowing that unfed children are suffering as we speak.”

	Realizing the strong determination the priest had, the others gave him a white coat. Not only would it keep him warm but also blend him with the snowfall. After putting on the coat and giving the others his thanks, the priest departed for the village, with the sleigh loaded with provisions.<br /><br />With his well-trained body, the father rushed through the frosted road, unaffected by the storm. At the halfway point, he saw two enormous shadows standing in his way.<br />The rumored deer Beasts blocked his path, gnarled antlers blocking out whatever moonlight was filtered through the snowfall. They spoke as one, their voices melding together, echoing within the father’s head.<br /><br />“Leave the sleigh and foodstuff behind. Do so and your mortal life will be spared.”<br /><br />However, the priest quietly ignored them and carried on with his sleigh. In anger, the giant deer attacked the priest with their twisted antlers, easily piercing through his skin, staining the white coat crimson.<br />The priest pressed on, not showing any sign of pain. Bleeding profusely, he continued as if nothing happened.<br />The deer Beasts were confused at this human’s actions, but that fact didn’t stop their onslaught. The priest’s immaculate coat became soaked through in blood, as if it was intentionally dyed red. A stark contrast to the environment that surrounded them.<br />Still, nothing could stop the priest from shuffling forward. His progress was slow, yet he progressed nonetheless.<br />Feeling exhausted and defeated from the seemingly useless attacks, the two Beasts couldn’t help but question the holy man.<br /><br />“Are you above mortal kind? Your skin tears so easily yet you refuse to fall. Have you not lost enough lifeblood to stop?<br />What is it that makes you so determined to continue forward?”

	<h4>For the Children in Need</h4>
	<strong>Unlock at Lv7</strong>

	The father of the church paused for a moment, smiling gently as if his wounds were nothing, calmly replying.<br />“I know there are children in the village ahead suffering from hunger. My suffering now, is nothing compared to theirs.<br />You see… years ago, I lost my own children during a great famine, and on that day, I swore to never let anyone suffer the same fate again.”<br /><br />The priest then took out some of the food, and set it in front of two deer Beasts. An offering.<br /><br />“Even Beasts like you don’t pillage innocent villages for your own gluttony. There must be an important one you are gathering it for. Now, I can’t give you everything I have, oh no, but I’m not heartless enough to refuse to share.”<br /><br />The two Beasts let the father pass, watching the man shuffle forward in silence, his offering deemed worthy enough to accept.<br />However, as time passed, they crossed paths with the priest again. This time, the deer Beasts meant no harm.<br /><br />“Indeed, we steal in order to feed the hungry children. You let us pierce through you with our antlers. If you continue through this blizzard with those wounds you will surely perish. As you have offered kindness despite the odds stacked against you, we shall repay the favor. Rest in the sleigh, for we will pull it to the village.”<br /><br />The two deer Beasts pulled the sleigh and carried the priest with them. Within moments, they arrived at the shambles of the village, where children greeted the priest with bursts of joy as they received the food they needed.<br />From that day on, whenever the father needed to deliver food to anyone in need, the two giant deer Beasts would always offer their services.<br /><br />The holy man who devoted his life to helping the ones in hunger eventually passed away. His deeds were recognized by the gods, who called him into the heavenly skies, greeting him as one of their own. After his death, his followers carried his belief and spread kind actions throughout Granzelia, and at the same time, spreading the name “Santa Claus” with them…

	<h4>In Memory of the Feat</h4>
	<strong>Unlock at Lv10</strong>
	<br /><br />
	After the death of Santa Claus, his followers continued his teachings, bringing food to the rural towns and villages in need.<br />It was also becoming a common practice for the followers to wear a red coat and refer to themselves as “Santa Claus” while carrying out the action. In memory of how he unyieldingly progressed forward, keeping his spirit in mind.<br />Following the tradition of that night, these followers use a sleigh to carry the food. Legend has it that the deer that pull these sleighs are descendants of the giant deer Beasts that helped the first Santa Claus.<br /><br />As the years passed, Granzelia had advanced in farming and food supplies. Seeing that food is no longer scarce, these Santas have stopped giving food, and instead, started to distribute candies and toys to continue to bring joy to children. This change was done following the teaching of the first Santa Claus: “My fellow family exist to always bring hopes and dreams to the children.”<br />Slowly, their actions were recognized throughout the world, which eventually became the festival we now know as “Christmas”.<br />The tradition of decorating Fir, Pine and Spruce trees comes from a legend that a tall tree grew at the resting place of the first Santa Claus, and decorating these types of trees was the locals’ ways of commemorating him.<br /><br />In honor to the saintly Santa Claus, the great festival of Christmas is even rumored to be acknowledged amongst the Gods. There are records indicating that even during the great war between God of Ruin and humanity, the two sides had a one day truce on the holiday.<br />Christmas in the present day is celebrated very differently from the past, as couples find it as a time to come together with each other instead of their own families. Although this day had always meant to be enjoyed with a person’s loved ones, the current Santa Claus has stated, "While we’re not against it, and they are a loved one, we believe it should not just be an event exclusive to couples. It must be a clash in cultures and lost in translation.”
