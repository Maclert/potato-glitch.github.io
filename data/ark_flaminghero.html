	<h4>The Warrior and the Girl</h4>
	<strong>Unlock at Lv2</strong>
	<br /><br />
	There once was a lone swordsman from the Kingdom of Lanzelia who wandered from place to place. He was on a journey to improve his skill in combat. He served no nation, and he simply sought to gain strength and find an opponent strong enough to satisfy his appetite for battle.<br />During his journey, the swordsman came across a girl being chased by a mysterious band of thieves. He tried to help her, but the girl pushed back against the thieves with her own power.<br />Charmed by her strength, the swordsman challenged her to a duel.<br /><br />However, the girl refused, stating that she was on a mission of her own and could not afford to spare the time. But when the man refused to back down, she begrudgingly explained the purpose of her journey in an attempt to persuade him.<br />The girl was on a quest to take down the God of Ruin and did not want to get anyone else involved.<br />Unfortunately for her, the swordsman only became more interested and decided he absolutely had to duel her. He insisted upon following her until they faced one another.<br />The girl refused again, but the swordsman ignored her and continued to follow her regardless.<br /><br />He brushed off the trouble he was causing her and did as he liked. At first, the girl was puzzled by his actions. But as she watched him conduct himself, she slowly began to express herself in the same free manner he did. Up until that point, she had her reasons for not being honest with others.<br /><br />At the time, the swordsman did not know anything about his unwilling travel companion’s background beyond the fact that she hailed from some kingdom in the south-west corner of the world.

	<h4>The Warrior's Record</h4>
	<strong>Unlock at Lv4</strong>
	<br /><br />
	Before the swordsman met her, his military prowess had been well-known throughout the continent. He first made a name for himself as a swordsman when he defeated a Beast in a snowfield.<br /><br />The continent of Lanzelia – and particularly the Kingdom of Lanzelia – has been well-known for cordial human-Beast relations. But at that time, strong monsters had been oppressing those weaker than themselves, while humans had been proactively protecting the weak.<br />The swordsman, perhaps conforming to that idea, singlehandedly brought down one such giant, tyrannical Beast.<br /><br />The swordsman was strong enough to oppose even the followers of the God of Ruin. Though he could not kill them, he was known to have successfully repelled the God of Ruin’s forces when they invaded a certain kingdom.<br />One conspicuous thing about his military record was that he used his strength for the sake of others.<br /><br />However, his end goal was strictly to improve his own strength. Afterward, he challenged and defeated an influential person in the kingdom. His victory against someone so famous earned him even more renown, but as his opponent commanded a considerable military force, this battle would have lasting repercussions.

	<h4>Warrior Against Knight</h4>
	<strong>Unlock at Lv7</strong>
	<br /><br />
	One day, the girl and the swordsman were attacked by Lanzelian soldiers at the Grand Wall of the Kingdom of Lanzelia. The soldiers surrounded the two of them under the command of the influential Lanzelian whom the swordsman had defeated in his quest to become stronger.<br />The girl had been unwittingly dragged into a revenge plot against him.<br /><br />While the soldiers weren’t too strong individually, they severely outnumbered the two travellers, who were subsequently separated in the fray. Nevertheless, the swordsman struck down soldier after soldier as he headed back to the girl. When he finally found her again, a lone knight blocked his path.<br />A soldier who witnessed the event firsthand would later testify:<br />“As commanded, we tried to defeat the swordsman, but then that knight showed up out of nowhere.<br />His sword was enveloped in ice. Obviously, we didn’t have any allies who met that description. However, it appeared that we had a common enemy in the swordsman for the time being, so we did not recklessly engage.<br />Their swords clashed, and it felt like everyone near the Grand Wall could feel the aftershock.<br />Then their swords seemed to clash again and again, but they moved too fast for our eyes to see. We were overwhelmed by the aftershocks alone. Eventually, everyone else stopped fighting and simply watched their duel. Not that we could see it very well.”<br /><br />This intense battle would go on for some time. The swordsman forgot about his original goal of defeating the soldiers and moving on, and lost himself in the ecstasy of crossing swords with a worthy opponent. In contrast, the knight’s sword was pointed at the swordsman in rage.<br />These polar opposite emotions collided in a battle of life and death.<br /><br />What finally brought an end to the battle was none other than the girl who had been traveling with the swordsman. She wedged herself between the two warriors and rebuked them both.<br />The surrounding soldiers could only watch, awestruck, as the three of them departed from the Grand Wall.

	<h4>Warrior Against Knight: The Sequel</h4>
	<strong>Unlock at Lv10</strong>
	<br /><br />
	What happened to the swordsman, the knight, and the girl after the battle at the Grand Wall?<br />There are actually records stating that the swordsman and the knight joined arms in an intense battle in some other land. According to these accounts, the soldier and the knight joined the girl in her quest to defeat the God of Ruin, with the soldier wielding the power of fire, and the knight wielding the power of ice.<br />Furthermore, they state that the swordsman and the knight did not reconcile so easily, and it would be appropriate to say that while they remained competitive, they acknowledged each other’s strength.<br /><br />Thanks to recent investigations, it has been made clear that the mysterious knight who had suddenly appeared at the Grand Wall was someone who had known the girl for a long time, but the details remain unconfirmed.<br />What is certain, however, is that the three of them journeyed together to gain enough strength to defeat the God of Ruin, as legends of them exist in many faraway places. Traces of their travels have been discovered in ancient ruins, leading to the hypothesis that these sites are somehow connected to a way to defeat the God of Ruin, and thus many are rushing to investigate.<br /><br />Their exploits predate those of the legendary heroes who sealed the God of Ruin, and thus, they were unfortunately unsuccessful in their quest.<br />It is said that they were separated during their battle, and their ultimate fates are shrouded in mystery.<br />However, it is firmly believed that those who later challenged the God of Ruin, including the heroes, were simply following in their footsteps. Thus, the efforts of the swordsman, the knight, and the girl were not in vain.
