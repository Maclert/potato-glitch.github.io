	<h4>Phantom Phoenix</h4>
	<strong>Unlock at Lv2</strong>
	<br /><br />
	The remi is a bird of fire that lives its long life in volcanic areas. This mysterious bird, wrapped in beautiful, wondrous flames, is scientifically classified as a kind of Beast, but there are many puzzling factors to its ecology.<br /><br />It does not attack people or other creatures, but when it does encounter other beings, it will not hide in fear or flee. Even if it encounters a soldier, the bird will calmly linger there, its penetrating gaze seemingly seeing through this passerby.<br /><br />Because of the harsh environment in which it lives, and its relatively small population, the remi is hardly spotted even by world travellers. For that exact reason, it's said that if you see a remi's stunning and beautiful form, the memory will stay with you until the end of your life.<br /><br />One adventurer said of his encounter:<br />“It was when I was fighting with the Gobls at Lauer Volcano. I thought there was a sudden guest of wind, and I felt a presence above my head.<br />The moment I looked up...<br />Honestly, time stopped.<br />There, in the clear sky, a beautiful flame hovered.<br />By the time I realized it was a remi, a bird of flame, it had already flown away.”<br /><br />Nowadays, the remi's form is depicted in many paintings based on eyewitness accounts. For this reason, many are inaccurate, but one could argue that it actually helps to spread the beautiful bird's impression even further.

	The painter Leirad followed the remi over the course of his life, and most of his works are of this blazing bird.<br />At first, he painted strictly based on the recollections of adventurers, but he eventually hungered for more. Leirad began traveling to and from a volcano where remi reportedly lived. He hired an adventurer to guide him safely, but simply going to the volcano wouldn't guarantee a remi encounter.<br />Somewhere over the course of multiple volcano visits, his funds to hire adventurers ran out.<br /><br />Leirad changed course, and instead decided to become an adventurer. By all rights, it should have been impossible to change from being a painter to being an adventurer with only half-baked effort, but his goal was to see the remi.<br />He only built up enough strength to escape danger, as he had no need to fight Beasts. He soon gained the vitality to freely walk the volcanic areas as he pleased.<br /><br />Despite the low chance of an encounter, he was able to catch sight of a remi with his own eyes, and create multiple, lifelike masterpieces. These paintings received high acclaim in the art world, and many of them were handed down to future generations.<br />At the same time, he made many new discoveries about the remi's biology, leaving detailed descriptions in his handbook, thereby making significant achievements in Beast research.

	<h4>The Flame of Life</h4>
	<strong>Unlock at Lv7</strong>
	<br /><br />
	Of all the remi paintings that Leirad made, his most famous masterpiece is “Existence and the Inferno.”<br />The painting depicts a perceptible form flapping its wings and a Remi’s egg tucked near a volcano crater.<br />Its perfection as a piece of work goes without saying, and it is still the single most highly regarded piece depicting the remi’s distinctive traits.<br />A remi has a long lifespan, but when the volcano it inhabits loses its vitality, legends say that it will throw itself into the crater to reignite the mountain.<br />Just before this, it lays a great number of eggs, and decades later, one among those many eggs will hatch and the bird of flame will be reborn.<br />For this reason, the bird of flame is regarded as an embodiment of the will of the land.<br /><br />Throughout history, there are so few people who have actually seen the bird’s self-sacrificial act that they can be counted. It is doubtful Leirad actually saw the scene he painted.<br />However, it is certain that his work, “Existence and the Inferno”, made the bird’s mysterious habits known to the public and secured the Remi’s popularity. Incidentally, after one bird of flame hatches from its egg, the remaining eggs all turn to stone for reasons unknown. <br />Why does the Remi only hatch one offspring, despite laying so many eggs?<br />Why do the other eggs turn to stone?<br />Neither is recorded is in Leirad’s notes, and so it is a topic for further research.

	<h4>An Odd Friendship</h4>

	<br /><br />
	One particular legend about the Remi’s eggs lingers. The legend says that a certain Remi, which had roots in the Gragia Mountains, had fought with a half Beast half human named Valdan who had been passing by.<br />Although the battle lasted three days and three nights, it did not come to a head, and eventually the two sides made peace. Thereafter, the two had a kind of strange friendship.<br />One day, the Remi made a request of Valdan.<br />“I’m about to lay my eggs and throw myself into the crater to revive the mountain. But there will be evil people that set their sights on my clutch of eggs.<br />I want you to protect the eggs from them.”<br />Valdan acknowledged this request.<br />Thus, the Remi laid her eggs and threw herself into the crater.<br />Just as the Remi had predicted, people aiming for the eggs came to invade Gragia Mountains. Keeping his promise to the Remi, Valdan met the assailants head-on, repelling any who came too close. However, the half-Beast half-human was wounded by the numerous battles and eventually neared failure.<br />It was then that one egg finally hatched. A newborn bird made its way out. The newly hatched Remi spread its wings and soared into the sky.<br />Valdan, who was covered with the embers, unbelievably felt his wounds and fatigue disappear, and he felt more power in his bones than ever before.<br /><br />This is a legend that has been passed down since antiquity, and its authenticity is doubtful. However, this story has been around since before the painter Leirad was born, and people have found the bird of flame both mysterious and desirable since days of old.
