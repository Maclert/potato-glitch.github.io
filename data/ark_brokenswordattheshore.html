	<h4>Rubel Naval Battle</h4>
	<strong>Unlock at Lv2</strong>
	<br /><br />
	The coast of Aldana... Many people come to this calm, gentle coastline to enjoy a dip in the summer.<br /><br />However, in the age of war with the God of Ruin, this was also the stage of great naval battles. The God of Ruin's followers came in to invade from the south, but soon became trapped in a deadlock. They had planned to land on the continental side of the coast, driving a wedge in place, with their sights set on total control.<br />The allied forces of humans and Beasts sensed this movement, and formed a fleet to intercept and prevent this plan.<br /><br />A sailor named Zexis became the deputy commander of the allied fleet and had a substantial amount of command.<br />He was originally a seaman of Port Aldana, but when assailed by pirates and Beasts during his voyages, he showed unparalleled strength in repelling them. His acts were noticed by the knights of the Holy Odal Kingdom, and he was drafted as a warrior.<br />He did not wish to be drafted, but while there, he learned the basics of battle and tactics.<br /><br />He then returned to Aldana, able to take security duty on official vessels and apply what he had learned. There was a good deal of resistance to such an unimportant person giving commands in the fleet, but the hero Adel had fought with Zexis and strongly vouched for him. As a result, this person of high esteem was nominally given the position of admiral, and Zexis became the deputy commander with a substantial amount of power.<br /><br />Zexis reorganized the fleet from a hodgepodge of ships and militia to a systematic naval force, even as he revisited the investigation of the tidal currents between the Rubel Coastline and Migal Island. Knowing that the currents coming south from Port Aldana to Migal Island were fast, he split the fleet in two.<br />One squadron was the main bulk of the force waiting for the enemy fleet along the beach. The other squadron was to sail from Port Aldana along Migal Island after the battle began, then attack the enemy fleet from behind.<br />Thus, the battle preparations were ready, and both squads sailed off in their respective ships to the decisive battlegrounds.

	“There was a spiteful wind blowing that day. The kind that makes your blood run cold. And that wind brought a chilling message from our scouting vessel: the God of Ruin's naval forces are getting close to the Rubel Coastline, and if things continue like this, they will probably be upon us come morning.<br />But we have our own strategy.<br />The first ship is already en route to Port Aldana. If all goes well, we should be able to attack from behind and make quick work of the enemy.<br />Everything is as planned... or so I have told myself, but I have never experienced such a big naval battle. I put the battle first and prepared for the next chapter in life.<br /><br />So, is this how you write a memoir?<br />I was burdened with a heavy responsibility.<br />After the war is over, I'll publish this memoir and make a killing. It would be good to have that as a sort of side gig at least.<br />By all rights, I really shouldn't have to bear such a problematic responsibility in the first place. The higher-ups were completely opposed to me commanding the fleet.<br /><br />That Adel moron... He declared, “He's the only one who can do it”, to the lot who were against it.<br />That one sentence changed it all. The king and the minister both — he went and convinced everyone with that one sentence. ‘Cause that guy's words somehow has the power to win people over.<br />For crying out loud, it was basically magic in the works.<br />Why do you even trust me that much? We only fought together once.<br />He screwed around saying stuff like, “You can see it in his eyes”, but to go and say, “He's the only one that can do it”?<br />Guess I'm under that idiot's spell as well."<br /><br />— Excerpt from a note by Zexis, discovered after the fact by researchers.

	“The battle was fierce. The power of the God of Ruin's army was tremendous, and my fleet suffered significant damage.<br />A subordinate came to report, “We can't hold the line if we take any more damage!”<br />I knew that.<br />I knew, but it was do or die.<br />I shouted encouragement at the people around me.<br />“We will not back down! Soon... Our allies are coming soon!”<br />Just then, I saw one of the God of Ruin's soldiers go to attack one of my officers. I threw myself in the way without missing a beat, but in that moment, I felt both a tremendous impact, and a strange lightness come to my body.<br />“Zexis! Your arm!”<br />I realized that one of my arms had been torn off. Oddly enough, there was no pain, and I saw the lack of a part of me that should have been there as though I was watching from another's eyes.<br />“Keep your heads! The real battle is yet to come!”<br />Even as I yelled this out, anxiety quickly spread among the soldiers. So this is the end... I was resigned to an extent.<br />But it was that moment that the lookout cried out in joy, “Reinforcements!”<br />I noticed that a new military ship on the other side of the enemy ship was visible. The separate squadron from Port Aldana had finally arrived.<br />The troops sprang back to action in that one moment. With my one remaining arm I took my beloved sword and barked out orders.<br />"Here is where we turn the fight around!"<br />"Yes sir!"<br />The officers, who had all been wearing such different expressions a moment ago, turned to face the enemy.<br />ARGHHHH!<br />Damn it, my arm!<br />Why is this happening to me?<br />Ugh, I get it. It's all to regain this world from that God of Ruin.<br />What a piece of work. We did well to win this time, but it was a close fight.<br />The loss of my arm is... regrettable, but preferable to throwing away my life. The God of Ruin's army is still out there, but I'm sure that Adel guy will do something about it.<br />I mean, he pushed me this far, so if he doesn't pummel that damned god, there's no way I'll let him get away with it.”<br /><br />— Excerpt from a note by Zexis, discovered after the fact by researchers.

	<h4>After the Naval Battle</h4>
	<strong>Unlock at Lv10</strong>
	<br /><br />
	During the battle at sea between the God of Ruin’s forces and the mashed-up army of mankind and Beasts near the Rubel Coast, it first seemed as though the allied forces were on the edge of defeat with their inferior numbers.<br />But soon enough, the other squadron arrived from the port, and they changed the tide with a pincer formation, making a swift comeback.<br />Commander Zexis struggled through the loss of his arm and eventually succeeded in destroying the God of Ruin’s army. Since then, the sea along the western coast of Aldana has remained in human control.<br /><br />Zexis, the orchestrator of the victory, received much praise and was offered positions by the officials of every country. He firmly declined them all, using his missing arm as the explanation.<br />After the war with the God of Ruin ended, he worked as a navigator.<br />As he grew old, he left his beloved sword on the fateful beach of the Rubel Coast, and said, “In the ground where my dominant arm lies, so too should my sword.”<br />It seemed as though he intended to publish a memoir of the naval battles that had occurred there. However, it’s said that he gave up in the end because he was unable to put it all together.
