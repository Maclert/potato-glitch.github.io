	<h4>Faulty Memory</h4>
	<strong>Unlock at Lv5</strong>
	<br /><br />
	A one-winged beast with the power of thunder, Rei's missing wing prevents full-on flight, but one wing is enough to glide briefly, enabling him to momentarily float or slow his speed when falling.
	<br /><br />
	He was discovered by a young Kyle on the verge of starvation, without any memory of who he was (beyond knowing that his name was 'Rei'). Unafraid, Kyle helped him back to his house and asked his surprised foster-father Davan to give him some food. Davan respected Kyle's strong will and did his best to help Rei recover. Rei developed a fondness for Kyle after that, and was living with them before they knew it.
	<br /><br />
	Back then, Kyle was very kind to Rei, but as he grew up, their relationship came to be more dominated by colorful banter and even fights. They've remained that way to this day, to the point where people think something's amiss if they're NOT bickering.
	<br /><br />
	Rei constantly calls Kyle a "doofus" or "moron", but it's clear from the way he says it that it's not such a bad thing. Rei sees himself as the guardian of a boy who can't be left to his own devices—that's why he accompanies Kyle everywhere, at least as he explains it. As far as their new redheaded acquaintance can tell, the two hang out with each other because neither would have it any other way.
	<br /><br />
	Beasts are seen as enemies to be subdued in Aldana and it's rare for a beast to have Rei's level of freedom, so many express ill will towards him. His ability to act independently with Kyle is thanks in no small part to Davan's use of his authority behind the scenes. Rei knows this very well, and though he may complain now and then, he's clearly grateful for everything Davan does.<br />
	<h4>A Convenient Interpretation</h4>
	<strong>Unlock at Lv30</strong>
	<br /><br />
	Rei's current memory began the moment he woke up in the Midra forest that borders the village of Ladour. Looking around he realized he had idea where he was and couldn't remember how he got there, either. For some reason he was injured all over and could barely move. Though he didn't know what had happened, the most pressing issue was hunger. In his current condition, however, he lacked the energy to search for food, let alone hunt. That's when he first met Kyle, at a time when he knew next to nothing about himself.
	<br /><br />
	Rei would later tell the blond girl traveling with them that he remembered his name the moment Kyle asked what it was. A strange look had appeared on Rei's face at the question, and he said he'd always been called "Rei." so they kept using that.
	<br /><br />
	Even though he forgot all past events in his life, he more or less retained the necessary knowledge for everyday life and for fighting. In fact, he sometimes has a better grasp on common sense than Kyle, causing Kyle to complain that Rei only suffers from memory loss at the most convenient of times. Rei is quick to retort that Kyle doesn't have any excuse to be so clueless since his memory is intact. Exchanges like this have happened more times than anyone can count.
	<br /><br />
	Kyle isn't sure exactly how much Rei really remembers, since he never talks about it. But that doesn't seem to bother him, and the two keep up their fighting and bickering to this day, same as ever.<br />
	<h4>About the Past</h4>
	<strong>Unlock at Lv50</strong>
	<br /><br />Rei almost never speaks to Kyle about his memories. One time Kyle concocted a plan to listen to Rei when he was talking in his sleep, to see if he could hear any clues. But Kyle fell asleep himself while he was waiting, so it didn't turn out to be very productive. He did, however, make out the following phrases:
	<br /><br />
	"Idiot! That's not your meat!"
	<br /><br />
	"Think before you move, moron!"
	<br /><br />
	"Where'd that cocky mage go?"
	<br /><br />
	In other words, Kyle's plan was an utter and total failure. Nevertheless, something bothered him about what he heard, and he nearly asked Rei about it. At the last minute he decided against it though, so everything went on as usual.
	<br /><br />
	Kyle would normally just let it slide when Rei doesn't want to talk about something, but helping his friend remember the past is so important to him that he keeps coming up with schemes to bring his memories back.<br />Unfortunately all his efforts end with the same thing: a swift kick and a growl of "Who cares?"
	<br /><br />
	Perhaps the real reason for Kyle's concern is that he can tell his friend is really bothered by not being able to remember his past.<br />
	<h4>The Odd One Out</h4>
	<strong>Unlock at Lv80</strong>
	<br /><br />When it became official that Rei and Kyle would move to the capital with Davan, rumors began to spread among the Imperial Knights. They were cruel, saying horrible things not only about Rei, but also Kyle and Davan, too. Rei and Davan for their part, couldn't have cared less (and Davan laughed so hard he cried over one rumor that Kyle and Rei were the reason for his bachelor status), but Kyle sometimes got pretty down and out.
	<br /><br />
	He wasn't bothered by the rumors about himself, but rather by the ones about Rei and Davan.
	<br /><br />
	Davan let the rumors slide at first, but when he saw how poorly Kyle was taking it he decided to address them head on. But he was too late — Kyle had already gotten into a fight with someone who'd bad-mouthed Rei.<br />Kyle drew his sword on the nobleman's son who wouldn't stop spouting slander, and just then Rei had appeared on the scene, and punched the guy even harder than Kyle had.<br />After knocking him into the street, Rei yelled, "You stupid humans think you can talk about me?! Keep at it and I'll crush your empty little head!"
	<br /><br />
	With that, he'd called down thunder on the whole area and disappeared.
	<br /><br />
	Kyle was left standing stock-still all by himself. When bystanders declared that it was all that beast's fault, Kyle came back to his senses and started yelling that in fact he was to blame, but no one listened.
	<br /><br />
	By the next day, the nobleman's son had spread the word that Kyle had been the instigator, and successfully shifted all the blame to him. In the end Davan had to intervene to make it clear that both the nobleman's son and Kyle were at fault.
	<br /><br />
	However, Rei later tried to leave the capital by himself. He left their house in the middle of the night, and headed to the edge of the city, but Kyle stopped him before he could make it out the gate.
	<br /><br />
	"That was all too stupid and annoying," Rei explained to his friend.<br />Kyle retorted that he'd seen Rei get more annoyed during one of their stupid fights.<br />That brought a big smile to Rei's face, and he replied, "The biggest mistake I ever made was letting a moron like you find me in the forest that day."<br />With that, he began to walk back the way he came.
	<br /><br />
	Ever since then, the two have never been seen apart from one another.
