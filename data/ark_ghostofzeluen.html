	<h4>Weird Tales! Ghosts of Zeluen!</h4>
	<strong>Unlock at Lv2</strong>
	<br /><br />
	One day in August, an envelope landed on the editorial desk of my magazine, “Weird Tales of Granzelia”. It was marked with the return address of Zeluen, an area not so far from the old capital of the Holy Kingdom Odal.<br /><br />The letter inside requested we investigate paranormal phenomena at a mansion on the village’s outskirts, so we editors hurried to convene with the sender – a delicate young woman, as it turned out. According to her, a grand estate which had once been home to aristocrats was now the haunt of ghosts, and though it was supposedly abandoned, the song of a piano could often be heard from within.<br />An intrepid soul once ventured within to investigate but was never heard from again.<br /><br />The afternoon was waning when we arrived at the mansion, whose grounds were startlingly expansive – in fact, they rolled on as far as the eye could see. Only someone of considerable social stature could have held a property such as this.<br />Passing through the front gate, we entered the front garden, which though overgrown, still hinted at the original estate holder’s sensibilities here and there. When we had drawn close enough to timorously peer into a window, an astounding spectacle presented itself to us: in the gloomy air there floated the translucent silhouettes of several men and women. In the course of our investigations, we had encountered many sights that beggared belief, but never had we so clearly witnessed specters dancing in the light of day.<br /><br />We suspected that harm could come to us if we proceeded, so we elected to first research the estate’s former owner. Nonetheless, we were stunned to hit upon a deed to the estate in the name of Muteus Hausen, the serial murderer who once terrified many lands under the alias of Blood Rose. As such, it was conceivable that the restless spirits of his female victims haunted the estate.<br /><br />Our small band of editors was scarcely equal to the task before us, and so we summoned to the mansion one Mr. Latos – a renowned medium rumored to be in the de facto control of the Church of the Creator.<br />The moment he set foot inside the structure, he tightly screwed up his face and made a statement none of us anticipated:<br />“These wandering souls were not slain by Blood Rose.”

	After a short stroll around the mansion, Mr. Latos seemed to have come to some kind of conclusion.<br /><br />“The spirits which haunt this mansion are possessed by an intense hatred for some unknown person which is keeping them tethered to our world.”<br /><br />According to him, the spirits within the mansion were being prevented from ascending by a powerful force which held the mansion within its unyielding grip.<br /><br />“If you want to do something about the spirits in this mansion, you will need to look into not only Blood Rose himself, but also the other members of his bloodline which have lived in the mansion for several generations.”<br /><br />Upon re-interviewing those living int he immediate vicinity of the mansion, we learned that many men as well as women had been seen there with some wearing strange clothing. Blood Rose was well known to kill and maim only women. If we assumed the spirits inhabiting the mansion all corresponded to his victims, it would be difficult indeed to explain why so many apparently male spirits were also present.<br />Following Mr. Latos’ advice, we began our investigation of the Blood Rose, aka. Muteus Hausen, and his clan.<br /><br />According to documents we obtained, the Hausen family was founded when the Holy Kingdom Odal added the continent of Aldana to its territory and the knight Darzal Hausen – who had assisted the kingdom subjugate the local population – was given an aristocratic title. The Hausen family flourished for some time thereafter while serving the royal family, but by the third generation, the then-head of the family Sartel Hausen purchased a certain curio from a dubious antique dealer who visited the house.<br />That purchase would prove pivotal in determining the family’s eventual fate.

	It is said that the object which Sartel Hausen, the third-generation scion to the Hausen family fortune, purchased from the antique dealer was in fact a grimoire of significant magical power. The grimoire is said to have contained elaborate descriptions of evil magics used by the God of Ruin and his agents to torture human victims, reflecting Startel’s murderous aesthetic preference for making his prey suffer before their death.<br /><br />It is unclear why a landed aristocrat such as Sartel would purchase such an ill-omened curio. However, Sartel was known to enjoy the sport of hunting; he ventured many a time into the surrounding forest with his servants, who often met with an “unintentional death” during Sartel’s excursions. Though merely speculation, some couldn’t help but wonder: did Sartel have the “same proclivities” as the person who authored the grimoire?<br /><br />After the death of Sartel, his grandson, Bermond became the fourth master of the Hausen estate at a tender age, and he inherited the grimoire as part of his grandfather’s assets. Though information regarding the young Bermond is sparse, he is known to have devoted himself to the mysteries of the magical realm since adolescence. He is reported to have sequestered himself inside an isolated room of the vast mansion, and shortly thereafter committed suicide under mysterious circumstances.<br />Thereafter, subsequent heirs to the Hausen family estate were known to become involved in all manner of strange mischief with many expiring under bizarre circumstances, and the entire Hausen clan eventually developed a reputation for misfortune.<br /><br />Blood Rose, a.k.a. Muteus Hausen, like many before him, inherited the Hausen estate following the death of his parents under strange circumstances, but unlike many of his ancestors Muteus was respected by his peers for his cheery disposition which seemed to mark an end to the dark shadow which plagued his line, and the clan once again seemed to have a bright future in store. Yet as many now know, Muteus’ life would eventually prove to be stained with more blood than any of his forebears.<br /><br />Yet there remains one question here likely worth asking: assuming that the cause of the Hausen family’s descent into insanity lies within the aforementioned grimoire, might the grimoire still remain within the mansion’s confines?<br />Our editorial department asked the powerful spiritual guide Mr. Latos to aid in our investigation again in order to answer the above question. Mr. Latos refused our request, stating that investigating the mansion was a task that even he could not possibly handle alone. However, he referred us to one of his mentors: a Mr. Besagne.<br /><br />Mr. Besagne maintained a keen interest in the story of the Hausen family and their infamous grimoire, and agreed to assist with our investigation. It was thus that our editorial staff along with Mr. Besagne decided to re-launch our investigation of the Hausen family mansion.

	Though we had previously visited the Hausen family mansion during daylight hours, per Mr. Besagne’s suggestion we decided that this time we would make our visit at night. According to Mr. Besagne, it would be easier to get to the bottom of what was going on if we conducted our investigation in the middle of the night, when most apparitions come out in earnest.<br /><br />In the moonlight, the abandoned Hausen family mansion seemed to exude a terrifying aura that seemed capable of sucking out any remaining warmth from the living, in stark contrast to its rustic appearance during the daytime. As we stepped into the mansion, we immediately spied an overwhelming cadre of ghosts floating before us as a group of translucent silhouettes. It was a terrible sight entirely incomparable to what we had witnessed during the daytime, and it left us stunned to the point of complete silence. As though they were mocking us, the ghosts moved about in front of our faces, making motions that suggested they might try and cling to us at any moment. Mr. Besagne simply laughed when he saw us completely stuck with fear and in shock.<br /><br />“You really don’t have to be afraid, you know. They won’t come in to attack you. Remain calm.”<br /><br />Our spirit guide then pushed forward, waving his hands as though to part the ghosts in front of him, and moved deeper into the bowels of the mansion. As though compelled forward by Mr. Besagne’s words, we followed closely behind him, barely able to conceal our fear. Though the ghosts continued to drift around us, it seemed that our guide was right and we did not appear to be in any immediate danger.<br /><br />With a placid expression on his face, Mr. Besagne first made his way to the second floor and we began our search. On the way there, we witnessed several strange happenings including floating furniture that seemed eager to fly in for an attack, but when our guide spoke a simple mantra these floating objects seemed to lose their power and fell to the floor. While many of us were unnerved by this, Mr. Besagne never changed his neutral expression, instead only opining in his glib way: “You often see that.”<br /><br />Mr. Besagne’s complexion changed for the first time, however, upon discovering a basement entrance in the mansion’s study on the first floor. Standing at the entrance, one could sense a foreboding aura emanating from within that was obvious even to our group of amateur ghost-hunters. Upon descending into the basement proper, we saw a long narrow hallway before us, down which Mr. Besagne led our party. However, as he moved through the passage, Mr. Besagne’s appearance suddenly started to change. At first, his countenance seemed to deteriorate slightly and though he claimed to be fine, he eventually began to sweat profusely and had to brace himself against the wall as he walked. Concerned, we called out to our guide but he had already become so weak that he could barely speak. Instead, he simply moved forward weakly, the glint of life completely gone from his eyes.<br /><br />Slowly continuing through the passage, our party eventually came to a large door. On the door we saw what can only be described as a magic circle, which appeared to have been drawn in blood. The door loomed ominously before us, and it occurred to me that this was the inevitable terminus of our long journey through the passage. Despite an intense sense of curiosity all the members of our party were hesitant to turn the doorknob. Just as one of our number placed his hand on the knob, we heard a loud scream.<br /><br />“No… Stop it!”<br /><br />It was Mr. Besagne who had raised his voice. He collapsed to the ground trembling and it was clear that he would no longer be able to walk under his own power. Sensing that something must be wrong, we decided that it would be prudent to carry Mr. Besagne out of the mansion at once for his own safety. When we arrived at a place some distance away from the mansion grounds, our guide had finally returned to his normal self, and this is what he told us:<br /><br />“Had we opened that door… I am certain that all of us would now be dead.”<br /><br />Later, we once again asked Mr. Besagne to accompany us for a follow-up investigation, but this time he did not assent. In fact, he eventually succeeded in persuading us to give up the investigation.<br /><br />“There are some things in this world which are better left undisturbed.”<br /><br />Given that we could no longer enlist the services of a professional, our team was forced to make a hard decision. That is, we decided to terminate our investigation of the Hausen family mansion for the time being. Though it was a bitter pill to swallow, our recent experience had taught us well the potential danger of carrying out an investigation into paranormal phenomena without the aid of a seasoned expert.<br /><br />However, we never gave up in trying to unravel the mystery of the mansion. We wish to assure our dear readers that we are still resolved to one day get to the bottom of the mystery surrounding this mansion once and for all.<br />We will never give up… <br />With our resolve we will act as a lone light in the darkness, unearthing the mysteries which prevail throughout our world!<br /><br />Afterword:<br />We later revisited the Zeluen region to report the findings of our previous investigation as well as our later decision and determination to the girl from whom the letter in question originated. Curiously, however, she was nowhere to be found in the village where we had last seen her. Not only did we fail to locate the girl, residents we later interviewed claimed that no such person had ever lived in the village.
