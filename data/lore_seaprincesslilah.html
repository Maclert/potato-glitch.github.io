	<h4>Lilah's Holiday</h4>
	<strong>Unlock at Lv10</strong>
	<br /><br />
	As the first princess of the Holy Odal Kingdom, Lilah was well-known for leading royal guards on quests to defeat Magical Beasts and helping the commoners.<br />However, legend also has it that during certain days of the year, Lilah will stop her regular campaign and take the entire team on a vacation. Detailed origin of this vacation can be found on the Lilah legacy section of the “Odal Royalty Chronicle”. <br />According to the history book, Lilah started the tradition when she overheard the conversation between two royal guards. One of them was holding his arm in pain, and the other was worried for him.<br /><br />“Argh…”<br />“Does your wound still hurt…? If it’s bad, you should take a few days off.”<br />“It’s no big deal compared to the injury you have on your arm.”<br />“…You know about my arm?”<br />“Yeah, of course. And just like you, I don’t have the time to rest.”<br />“I guess you’re right. Princess Lilah is always leading us bravely. There’s no way we can let her down!”<br /><br />Lilah thought about the conversation for the entire night. The next coming, Lilah told Saria, commander of the royal guards, that she wanted a vacation. Immediately, Saria searched for the perfect location, and arranged a tour for her. With everything set, Saria reassured Lilah that there’s no need for worries while she’s gone – the guards would handle the monsters just as usual.<br />However, Lilah gave her an unexpected response.<br /><br />“Don’t be ridiculous. Aren’t you my guards? You’ll have to come along with me.”

	<h4>Vacation</h4>

	For her vacation, Lilah went to a calm beach. Although the exact location wasn’t written in “Odal Royalty Chronicle”, many speculated the beach was either near Gorde Village, or perhaps to the west of the capital, near the Nazrica region (currently known as Babalaad).<br /><br />A short while after arriving at the resort, Lilah and the royal guards had started to enjoy themselves, as it was their first vacation in a long time. Some went for hte sea, some stayed for sunbathing, and some relaxed themselves in the shades. When Lilah insisted for the guards to come along, Saria initially thought that it was a whimsical gesture. However, seeing how the guards reacted to the vacation, Saria too realized that the guards were extremely exhausted from their everyday battles. With an understanding of Lilah’s intentions, Saria no longer stood in opposition, and decided to enjoy the “vacation” as well.<br />(Nonetheless, she did have a word or two about how revealing Lilah’s swimsuit was.)<br /><br />For Lilah, it was a rare instance where she didn’t have to be a warrior, or the princess of the Odal royal family. Instead, she could just relax as herself.<br />However, Lilah soon felt that something was out of place.<br />Despite being the perfect beach day, with bright sun and calm waves, there were no other guests at the beach. Trying to find an answer to the odd situation, Lilah asked Saria if she had reserved the entire resort. It turned out to not be the case.<br />As Lilah pondered over the oddity, an elderly man approached her apprehensively. That man was the chief of a fishing village nearby.

	<h4>An Unusual Beast</h4>

	<br /><br />
	It began when the village chief told them that he had come to request for help. He was aware that Lilah and her guards were on vacation, but they were the only ones that can solve the problem.<br /><br />According to the chief, tourists hadn’t come to the beach because a Magical Beast had been spotted near the area.<br />Lilah questioned the chief why he didn’t evacuate the villagers or asked the Kingdom for military support. The chief answered that it wouldn’t be necessary, as this particular Beast wasn’t harmful to humans or crops. However, it was still quite troublesome, as the Beast was acting unfriendly.<br /><br />“Is it really possible for such an unusual Beast to exist?”<br /><br />Although she heard every word the chief said, Lilah still had no clue to what the Beast was. However, she was determined to take care of it. She decided it was best to pause the vacation and assemble the guards to defeat the Beast. <br /><br />By following the chief’s words, they found the troublesome Beast lurking inside a sea cave. The Beast turned out to be a Jelly Queen. Certainly, a Jelly Queen was powerful, but nothing they couldn’t handle. As a matter of fact, Lilah had defeated several Jelly Queens before.<br /><br />Lilah and the guards surrounded the Beast, ready to launch an attack when suddenly, the Jelly Queen tried to intimidate them by shooting out gooey fluid.<br /><br />This surprised the knights, and even Lilah.<br /><br />“Ah…! My clothes…!”

	<h4>A Surprising Subspecies</h4>

	<br /><br />
	“Ah…! My clothes…!”<br /><br />After being splattered by the Jelly Queen’s gooey fluid, Lilah came to the realization that it dissolved her clothing. It appeared that this Jelly Queen was a mutated subspecies.<br /><br />“I can see why the tourists didn’t want to come to the beach anymore. We have to take down this Beast immediately!”<br /><br />Lilah gave her commands and tried bravely in fighting the Beast. However, as she was distracted by her dissolved outfit, she couldn’t concentrate her powers onto her arrows.<br />Perhaps the Jelly Queen realized its advantage, as it spouted more body fluids in its attacks. At the same time, Saria and the other guards launched their attacks, but none were able to decisively damage this tough Beast.<br /><br />The royal guards were met by an unexpectedly hard fight. As they struggled, Lilah suddenly regained her powers and struck the Jelly Queen with her arrows. To the surprise of everyone present, Lilah had discarded her clothing, and she joined the battle in her swimsuit.<br />It turned out that they were in such a hurry to defeat the Beast, that Lilah didn’t actually change out of her swimsuit, but wore it under her combat uniform all along.<br /><br />“I apologize for letting you worry about me, but I’m fine now. Time to take down this Beast once and for all!”<br /><br />Empowered by the words of their princess, the royal guards attacked the Beast gallantly. With Princess Lilah returning to the battle in full strength, the team defeated the Beast without further trouble.<br /><br />The “Odal Royalty Chronicle”, which recorded Lilah’s legacy, described the battle as such:<br /><br />“And thus, the swimsuit of Princess Lilah shined as a glorious flag of victory.”<br /><br />Having defeated the Jelly Queen, Lilah and her guards returned to the beach and enjoyed their remaining vacation. They would return to the capital a few days later, completely recovered from their exhaustion. It was said that the group resumed their quests and followed Lilah’s commands more devotedly than ever before.
