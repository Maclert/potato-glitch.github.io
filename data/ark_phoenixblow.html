	<h4>Romel, God of War</h4>
	<strong>Unlock at Lv2</strong>
	<br /><br />
	There was once a battle so fierce at the former Malboria Lava Caves, that it changed their very topography.<br />It was the battle between Romel, the martial artist known as the God of War, and the flame demon that lived in the lava caves.<br /><br />At the time, Romel was still only known to warriors of Mordana and other martial artists, but he was already starting to stand out from the crowd because of his strength. When he went around testing his skills against members of other schools, he drove many of their dojos to closure.<br />He even easily defeated Freg, a legendary brawler.<br /><br />Those who bore a grudge against Romel hired a famous assassin to take him out, but he easily defeated this assassin despite them catching him off guard.<br />Through these battles, Romel further honed his skills, but he gradually started losing the feeling of joy from beating ordinary foes. And so, he decided that his next target would be the flame demon that lived in Malboria Lava Caves in Aldana.<br /><br />Romel boldly marched into the caves and challenged the flame demon to a one-on-one battle. That fight was not contained to just the caves — it was an intense battle that took place over the entire Malboria Mountain Range.<br />It is said that the shape of some of the mountains changed considerably as a result. It was indeed that fierce of a battle, but unfortunately, we know few details about it as most is derived from tall tales. The Malboria Lava Caves were in an area too dangerous to traverse, and therefore not a location that saw frequent travellers, so there were no eyewitnesses to this battle.

	Even now, there is ongoing research into the many tales of Romel’s deeds. He was and is still a notorious figure. However, the fight between Romel and the flame demon remains shrouded in mystery. We also do not know what the flame demon truly was or where it came from.<br /><br />One researcher went to interview the people who lived around the Malboria Mountain Range in hopes of figuring out more about the flame demon.<br />According to what they learned, the demon was not related to any local tales, so there is conjecture that the demon was not indigenous to the area. Some suspected it might have been one of the God of Ruin’s underlings, but the demon rarely left the lava caves and did not act in any conspicuous way even during the great war between the God of Ruin and humanity (excluding the fight between itself and Romel), so the probability of that theory is low.<br /><br />At present, the flame demon cannot be found anywhere in all of Granzelia, let alone in the Malboria Lava Caves. We do not know why or how it disappeared, but it is said that it disappeared during the eruption of the former Malboria Lava Caves, and actually traveled to the other world with Romel.<br />As a result, many speculate that the demon originally came from another world. On the other hand, some theories suggest that the demon was created by a certain research institution as an imperfect god. However, scientific societies regard this theory as being semi-occultist, and it has very few supporters.

	As mentioned previously, there were practically no eyewitnesses to the battle between the heroic Romel and the flame demon, and so we do not know any of the details about the fight. Regardless, it wound up greatly inspiring the imagination of later authors and researchers. As a result, there are multitudes of studies and books about their encounter.<br /><br />“When Romel, the God of War, stepped into the lava caves, he came face-to-face with the flame demon. They both gave off murderous auras, and it was plain as day that there would be blood. The flame demon made the first move.<br />It shot molten lava and flames at Romel. Romel swept it all aside as he started closing in on the demon. He had it in his sights when the demon brandished its strong arms to meet Romel’s attack.<br />However, Romel easily stopped the blow. The flame demon was astonished that the comparatively small man was able to stop its attack and instinctively tried to leap back to put some distance between them.<br />Romel did not fail to notice this. The flame demon had shown an opening and Romel punmmeled at it with his fists, severely wounding the demon.”<br /><br />– Excerpt from “Records of Romel, the God of War”<br /><br />“Romel and the demon looked into one another’s eyes and then both began to move at once to attack.<br />The demon launched at Romel without pause, an overwhelming power behind each strike.<br />Romel staved off its attacks, waiting for his chance to counter. The battle raged on, with the flame demon never able to land a critical hit with its mighty blows and flames, and Romel never finding the right opening to make his move. This battle to the death lasted from day into night. At night, it looked like the very mountains themselves were on fire.<br />However, Romel perfected a new move as a result of this long battle: ‘Phoenix Blow’. The moment this move burst out from him, Romel’s fists whirled, piercing the very flames of the demon’s body.<br />And then, when Romel claimed his victory, there was enough damage to the surrounding areas that maps had to be redrawn.<br /><br />– Excerpt from “Secret Move ‘Phoenix Blow’”<br /><br />“Records of Romel, the God of War” and “Secret Move ‘Phoenix Blow’” are the two most well-known works that tell the story of this battle. Between the two, “Records of Romel, the God of War” took comparatively more creative liberties with the story, while “Secret Move ‘Phoenix Blow’” was written based on the legends that had been passed down by the residents who lived near the former lava caves.<br />While the move used in the title, “Phoenix Blow”, was well-known as one of Romel’s moves, there are no records of him ever actually using it. It is speculated that this part of the story was completely made up.

	Although there were no eyewitnesses to the fight itself, there were indeed people who were in the vicinity at the time of the fight.<br />There are some accounts about Romel and the battle from people who lived near the area.<br /><br />Right before he went to the lava caves, Romel had visited the neighboring village. There, he asked the villagers questions about the demon of flame. It was unusual that Romel, who boasted his matchless strength and was pretty much undefeated, would inquire about his target ahead of time.<br />We can assume that he was greatly anticipating the fight with the flame demon.<br />That evening, there were continuous eruptions and explosions from the Malboria Mountain Range. The villagers trembled in fear, thinking that the end of the world was upon them.<br />There was a report from a villager that just before daybreak, they heard something like a scream amid the noise of the eruption, but we do not know whether it was from Romel.<br />The next morning, after the eruptions and explosions had ended, the villagers cautiously went to check on the state of the mountains. They were shocked to find that the terrain of the surrounding area had been greatly altered.<br />Ignorant about the battle that had taken place, they came up with rumors such as two gigantic Dabournes had self-destructed, or that the mountains erupted because of the God of Ruin’s wrath.<br />They were later appalled to find out that it had all been caused by the battle between Romel and the flame demon.<br /><br />There were no strange occurrences in the vicinity of the lava caverns for a time after that, but after the great war between the God of Ruin and humanity, the volcano where the lava caves were had erupted violently.<br />Someone had sighted a man heading toward the caverns just before it happened, but nobody knows exactly who it had been.
