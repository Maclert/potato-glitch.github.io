	<h4>Birth of a Master</h4>
	<strong>Unlock at Lv2</strong>
	<br /><br />
	Back in the days when Granzelia was under the God of Ruin’s despotic rule, a merchant discovered a huge vein of crystal near an abandoned castle in the Dara Desert. It seems that at the time, crystal was valued as a source of various powers. The merchant tried to keep the crystal to himself, but other forces immediately began marching for the location of the vein.<br />The Holy Odal Kingdom who had heard of the lode’s discovery, immediately wished to claim it as its own; the Beasts instinctively sought crystal as the source of their own power.<br />In order to protect his own interests in the crystal, the merchant tried to hire Master Ferris’ sellswords, who were then well-known as a strong mercenary force.<br /><br />Ferris was originally from the Holy Odal Kingdom. Born in a particularly poor area, she had taken up a blade as soon as she was old enough to know what it was, and she had become a staple on the front lines of battles against nations and Beasts ever since.<br />Although she felt some doubts about fighting, she believed in the words of the nobility: “Prove yourself in battle and you shall have what you desire.”<br /><br />Despite their poverty, her family had never lacked for love and, in order to give them a life of plenty, she continued to dedicate herself to the harsh duty of war. But eventually, her loyalty was betrayed. During a particular battle, the kingdom enacted a horrific strategy: they purposely lured a mob of Beasts to Ferris’ village, then burned the entire village to eradicate them.<br />Unaware of the plan, the villagers, including Ferris’ family, were all burned alive. Despite being part of the Beast eradication force, Ferris had heard nothing of the plan.<br /><br />Seeing her home go up in flames, and the family she had meant to protect, burning to death before her very eyes, she cursed her own inability to save them and the cruelty of the Odal Kingdom for going through with such tactics.<br />Immediately following the incident, Ferris defected from the Odal Army.<br />There is no clear record of her movements for the following years. The next time her name surfaced in history, was as the leader of a mercenary army when she led anti-Odal forces to victory in battle.

	<h4>The Ultimate Mercenary Squad</h4>
	<strong>Unlock at Lv4</strong>
	<br /><br />
	Ferris had not forgiven the Holy Odal Kingdom for taking the lives of her beloved family, and she accepted the merchant’s request to protect the crystal.<br />The mercenaries came from all different backgrounds, their own commonality being that they all had some unique and exceptional skill in combat.<br />This was the main criterion in order to become a member of the mercenary army. It is said that they did not accept anyone who could not demonstrate exceptional artistry in battle, no matter how desperately the hopefuls desired to join.<br />At first blush, this may seem like a harsh stance to take toward those who wanted to join, but the battles Ferris and her crew put themselves in were the fiercest of fights, and they regularly encountered the kind of danger that would quickly snuff out the life of anyone not up to the task. The stringency toward potential recruits was actually a kindness on Ferris’ part, in order to protect their lives.<br />Still, there was no end to those wanting to sign up. Their eagerness is understandable when you consider that each sellsword had an outstanding combat record in the various battles they fought.<br /><br />The oldest member was an archer who, like Ferris, had grown up in poverty. He fought alongside her for many years. Tales are still told of how he had fought on the side of an autonomous region opposing the Holy Odal Kingdom and killed the enemy leader with a single arrow, leading to the collapse of the entire army.<br /><br />In charge of the mercenaries’ flanks, along with the archers, was a sorcerer. Originally from a family of clergymen in the Holy Odal Kingdom, he had grown tired of the life his bloodline demanded of him and had been enchanted by the way Ferris forged her path with her own power. When the sorcerer fought in a war to gain control of a neighboring region, he famously built up the fortress which would become their base in a single night, and led their forces to victory.<br /><br />But these two were far from the only exceptional members of Ferris’ mercenary group.<br />One soldier had tossed boulders to block a road that was hundreds of feet wide, in order to cut off an enemy retreat.<br />A spearman had repelled an entire siege with just 1000 soldiers.<br />The mercenary army gathered together the mightiest warriors around. But above all, Ferris’ achievements shone the brightest. Putting to use the swordsmanship she had cultivated since she was a young girl, Ferris placed herself in the vanguard during their battles with followers of the God of Ruin, and she mowed down the enemy with incredible prowess.

	<h4>Struggle at the Abandoned Castle</h4>
	<strong>Unlock at Lv7</strong>
	<br /><br />
	Thus, Master Ferris’ sellswords were hired by the merchant, and they readied themselves at the abandoned fortress near the crystal lode.<br />As they were making preparations, both Beasts and the Holy Odal Kingdom’s army were already closing in on the vein, and the mercenary group was soon surrounded. As the merchant flapped around in panic, Ferris and her sellswords concentrated on analyzing the situation.<br />They established that the Beasts and the enemy army had separate bases close to the crystal, and that those bases were in a state of disorder.<br /><br />As the sun set, the sellswords carefully approached both encampments. Their plan was a tricky one: they aimed to spread rumors to both camps, inciting them to fight one another.<br /><br />The archer cried, “The Beasts are raiding us! Hurry and counterattack!”<br />The sorcerer cried, “The Holy Odal Kingdom’s army is sneaking ahead to try and monopolize the crystal! If we don’t hurry, there’ll be none left for us!”<br />Under cover of darkness, the archer and sorcerer each unleashed their rumors into the enemy encampments before slipping away.<br /><br />Both the Beasts and the army crumbled in a state of confusion. Unsuspecting of the mercenaries and believing one another to be the enemy, they began to fight.<br />After fighting to a standstill, both sides withdrew in exhaustion. Despite being outnumbered, the sellswords had driven back the enemy without even lifting a finger.<br /><br />Eventually, the Holy Odal Kingdom’s forces regrouped and formed a vanguard of soldiers from Aldanian territories. After mopping up the last of the Beasts in the area, they once again surrounded the mercenaries’ fortress.<br />Their strength was greater this time, but while it was a hard fight, the mercenaries fended off wave after wave of attacks.<br />And of course their captain, Ferris, was in the thick of it. Saying that she would not stand back and let others fight for her, she drew her sword and rushed at the enemy, breaking through their battle formation.<br />With her comrades at her back, she led the charge to crush their enemy’s position.

	<h4>After the Dust Settles</h4>
	<strong>Unlock at Lv10</strong>
	<br /><br />
	Although Ferris and her sellswords were successful in fending off the Holy Odal Kingdom’s forces, they found themselves gradually cornered by the enemy’s sheer numbers.<br />As the battle raged on, Ferris decided to make a last-ditch plan of attack: they would launch an assault aimed directly at the main body of the enemy, and take down their commanding officer.<br />Staying true to their course, the sellswords came together as a single unit and charged forward.<br />At the head of the charge was Ferris, who shone with light like a true god of war. The archer, the sorcerer, and everyone else followed hot on her heels, lending her their strength.<br />The power of the sellswords’ bone broke through the enemy lines, and Ferris was able to take down their leader.<br />“It’s all over,” they thought.<br /><br />But their joy lasted mere seconds, for the God of Ruin appeared on the battlefield, and set about annihilating both forces and the vein of crystal over which they had fought.<br />The soldiers fell one after another.<br />The archer and the sorcerer gave their lives to protect Ferris.<br />Despite the despair she felt in the face of the God of Ruin’s overwhelming power, Ferris attempted a lone assault to avenge her comrades, not caring if it resulted in her death.<br />When her blade was but inches away from the god, she was killed by its onslaught, and the entire remaining army was wiped out.<br />The crystal vein, which had been the source of the conflict, was also obliterated. Some theorize that the God of Ruin had brought the crystal to Granzelia in order to watch the greedy go to war over it – the ultimate entertainment.<br />The god of Ruin had wished for the forces who had coveted the crystal to decimate each other entirely.<br />But when Ferris and her sellswords survived, the God of Ruin had chosen to descend to the arena to clean up its personal playground.<br />To this day, the truth remains shrouded in darkness, together with the smashed and scattered crystal.
