	<h4>Sailors' Legend</h4>
	<strong>Unlock at Lv2</strong>
	<br /><br />
	There is an old legend handed down among the sailors at Port Granada in Aldana. The legend says there is a shrine at the bottom of the ocean, to the east of the city. It was built to enshrine the Sea Dragon, the guardian deity of the ocean, and is protected by water spirits.<br /><br />Up until now, this legend amounted to nothing more than a fairy tale. However, something happened in recent years that changed the way people viewed this legend.<br />Ancient ruins – now thought to be the Sea Dragon’s shrine – were found at the bottom of the sea to the east of Port Granada.<br />Since their discovery, researchers from all corners of the world have tried to investigate, but with the shrine at the bottom of the sea, it has proved a challenging task.<br />No one has entered the innermost chamber of the shrine, and researchers still have yet to pinpoint the architectural style or come up with an estimate as to when it was built.<br /><br />Incidentally, the port city of Granada has enjoyed an increase in tourists and researchers since the shrine’s discovery, and it is now a bustling city like never before. However, the locals have not been very receptive of this burst in popularity. They are afraid that some of the fishermen might anger the water spirits by disturbing the shrine, which might lead to accidents at sea or poor fishing seasons.<br />They regularly patrol the area near the underwater shrine, checking to see if there are any suspicious boats.

	A statement from a citizen of Port Granada:<br />“I’ve heard the story of the shrine and the Sea Dragon countless times from my grandpa. I knew it was a fairy tale, but I never expected them to find an actual shrine…<br />Regardless of whether the Sea Dragon part is real or not, doesn’t the fact that it exists make your imagination soar?”<br /><br />A statement from an elderly fisherman:<br />“I’m glad they found the Sea Dragon’s shrine, but I’m not so keen on people constantly trying to investigate it…<br />I understand where the scholars are coming from, but I’m worried about there being some kind of accident as a result of them inciting the Sea Dragon’s rage.”<br /><br />A young architectural scholar:<br />“The shrine is incredible!<br />What’s so incredible about it?<br />The style of the architecture, obviously! As far as I know, we’ve never found a historic site in this style in the history of the continent!”<br /><br />Eccentric geologist:<br />“It’s a curious site alright…<br />There aren’t any records of the land sinking on such a large scale in this area. I tried digging up and examining the geological features at the bottom of the sea around here, and from what I can tell, it’s gotta be ancient…<br />That being said, how the heck did they manage to build such a big shrine under the sea?”<br /><br />Facetious folklorist:<br />“At present, everyone’s given up at finding out who built the shrine and how. That must mean the answer is something out of the ordinary. And that’s where folklore comes in.<br />The origins of this shrine must have something to do with the legend of the Sea Dragon. That legend wasn’t passed down for nothing, you know.<br />I really hope we can find traces of the Sea Dragon and the water spirits.

	<h4>Sea Dragons and Water Spirits</h4>
	<strong>Unlock at Lv7</strong>
	<br /><br />
	The legend passed down by sailors at Port Granada goes something like this:<br /><br />Once, a long time ago, there lived a Sea Dragon in Granada’s coastal waters. This dragon raised havoc in the sea, destroying most of the ecosystem that supported the marine life.<br />And then one day, while hunting for food in other waters, it ran into a giant squid. They instantly started to attack each other. The Sea Dragon snapped at it with its sharp fangs, but the giant squid did not falter; it wrapped its ten tentacles around the Sea Dragon, binding it.<br />The Sea Dragon frantically tried to fight back, but the giant squid secreted a poison from its beak and used that to immobilize the Sea Dragon further.<br />Having lost its will to fight, the Sea Dragon managed to flee despite its nearly fatal wounds. By the time it reached its territory, it had already lost the ability to move.<br />All that was left was to await death.<br /><br />But then, strange bubbles started appearing around it, healing its wounds. When it looked more closely at them, it discovered that the bubbles were actually the water spirits who lived in that area of the sea.<br />Considering all of the atrocities it had committed, the Sea Dragon found it baffling that the spirits were saving it. But it turned out that the Sea Dragon had actually once saved these spirits from creatures that were attacking them.<br />The Sea Dragon had only done that on a whim, but knowing that such a small choice had saved its life, the Sea Dragon decided to rethink its behavior.

	<h4>The Sea Dragon's Temple</h4>
	<strong>Unlock at Lv10</strong>
	<br /><br />
	After being saved by the water spirits, the Sea Dragon that had once wrought havoc in the sea started protecting it instead.<br />The effects were tremendous. Ferocious creatures in the sea world tremble during the Sea Dragon’s patrols and no longer tried to pointlessly disturb its territory. Naturally, as peace was maintained and the number of creatures in the sea increased, bigger creatures and Magical Beasts began to target the Sea Dragon’s territory.<br /><br />The first to target the Sea Dragon’s territory was a whale with the head of a dog, known as Kest. The battle against the might of Kest’s powerful jaws turned out to be a hard fight for the Sea Dragon.<br />However, despite multiple bite wounds and tears, the Sea Dragon managed to bite off Kest’s head, and somehow came out as the victor.<br /><br />The next to come after the Sea Dragon’s territory was the same giant squid that had mortally wounded the Sea Dragon before. So as to not repeat the mistakes of the past, the Sea Dragon shot water currents at the squid from afar, taunting it. It wasn’t long before the giant squid lost its temper and rushed at the Sea Dragon. However, the Sea Dragon adroitly avoided it, and the giant squid crashed into rocks. The giant squid lost its senses, and the Sea Dragon bit and tore into its head, successfully repelling the enemy.<br /><br />According to the legend, after that, the Sea Dragon fought and won against a crab the size of a mountain, a giant shark with sharp fangs and horns, and other Magical Beasts. It continued to protect the peace of the ocean.<br />The creatures that lived at the bottom of the sea sung the Sea Dragon’s praises and joined together with the water spirits to build a shrine dedicated to their protector. However, around the same time the shrine was completed, the Sea Dragon stopped appearing.<br />It is said that the Sea Dragon had reached its limits after all the fighting, and secretly passed away in the depths of the shrine. <br />Others say that it is merely sleeping in the shrine still, recovering its strength.
