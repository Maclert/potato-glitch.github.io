	<h4>The First Steal</h4>
	<strong>Unlock at Lv10</strong>
	<br /><br />
	Robin made a name for himself as a chivalrous thief who stole from the rich, but he also made a habit of exploring ancient ruins. The treasures... well, machinations that ruins typically hid were obscurities only experts knew the value of, so they were quite difficult to fence. As such, it's a mystery as to why he made the journeys he did, and speculation certainly abounds. But in recent years, documents have finally been uncovered that shed some light on Robin's youth.<br /><br />Robin grew up in the slums and lost his parents at an early age. The only family he had left was his gravely ill little sister.<br />He became known for his noble charity and boisterous heists, but his early thievery had no such theatrics. He picked pockets and robbed houses to pay for food and his sister's medicine. And to make matters worse, his sister showed no signs of recovery. In fact, her symptoms only grew more severe.<br />But one day, Robin heard a rumor. A rumor that a massive haul of treasure had been stashed away inside a nobleman's mansion.<br /><br />Robin had never snuck into a high-class mansion before, but he decided to make an exception for the sake of his sister. A nimble thief even at such an early age, Robin found the treasure with security being none the wiser and carried out as many different jewels as he could hold. However, the ease with which he was able to do so made him cocky. His attempt to escape from a window triggered a magical alarm, alerting the guards to an intruder.<br /><br />"Oh man... I screwed up!"<br /><br />Robin tried to flee, but the guards quickly surrounded and captured him. The nobleman, furious that his treasure was almost stolen, drew his blade in an attempt to execute Robin on the spot.<br />Robin prepared for the worst.<br />Until a voice spoke to his heart. It was the Ark, an item hidden among the treasures Robin had stolen that was now lying at the nobleman's feet.<br /><br />"If thou will solve the riddles of the ancient ruins and seal what lies inside, I shall grant thou the strength to survive this crisis and the skill to save that which thou love."

	<h4>Power and Resentment</h4>

	Despite his misgivings, Robin shouted, "It's better than bein' dead. Give me strength!"<br /><br />Robin immediately took the Ark up on its offer. When he did, he could feel strength welling up within him. He tore off the rope that bound him and defeated the nobleman and his guards in the blink of an eye.<br />Robin was surprised, but mostly relieved, by this newfound power, so he took the Ark and left for home. He immediately used the Ark's power to heal his sister, and she finally showed signs of recovery though they were slight.<br />From then on, Robin would use the Ark's power to become a legendary thief to fund his sister's medical expenses.<br /><br />At first, Robin stuck to his familiar pickpocketing and burglary, but with the Ark's power, he slowly worked his way up to larger heists. As he swiped more priceless treasures from under the noses of the wealthy, the people began to applaud his actions. <br />But the excessive praise and the limitless power of the Ark went to his head. He stole more treasure than he needed. What money he didn't spend on the best medicine available went toward treating his sister to lavish meals. But this served only to make her more suspicious.<br />She eventually learned of Robin's thievery and realized that all of her medicine and food had been paid for with crime. She was so stricken with grief that she rejected the man she had called a brother.<br /><br />This finally pushed Robin to realize the error of his ways. He vowed from then on to never steal from the poor... or from the beautiful. He then began to give nearly all of his spoils to the poor.

	<h4>The Incident</h4>
	<strong>Unlock at Lv50</strong>
	<br /><br />
	And so, Robin began the philanthropic thievery he would be known for. He never reconciled with his sister, but he could at least rest easy knowing that she was healing due to the effects of the Ark.<br />Since the Ark was keeping up its end of the bargain, Robin felt he should uphold his, and so began traveling to ruins. These excavations brought him face-to-face (and sometimes side-by-side) with people such as a prince or a dual-wielding swordswoman, but it's said that Robin preferred to work alone.<br /><br />One day, Robin noticed a change within himself. He snuck in for a routine heist but was found out by the guards. He failed to outrun these knights and was forced to engage in combat, and that's when he noticed something was off.<br />Of course, Robin was never a slouch in a fight, so he defeated his pursuers with ease. But the problem was how he did so. He felt a rush during battle that he'd never felt before, and inflicted far more damage on the knights than was necessary.<br />Once he came to his senses, Robin was horrified at what he had done. He soon learned that the cause of this sensation was none other than the Ark he was holding. This cycle of violence happened again and again, growing only more frequent as time went on.<br /><br />Was the Ark leading him toward destruction? Despite his doubts, Robin couldn't bear to part with the Ark. Doing so would cut off his sister's treatment.<br />Besides, he wanted to have faith in the Ark for allowing him to become the philanthropic thief he was.

	<h4>Revived Pride</h4>
	<strong>Unlock at Lv80</strong>
	<br /><br />
	Robin returned to his ruin excavation, hoping that fulfilling his initial bargain of sealing the ruins could get the Ark to stop spurring on his destructive impulses.<br /><br />But there was one other person who caught on to Robin's changes. He was a prince from a distant land who had been following Robin's trail. He noticed this change when Robin sprung a trap that an aristocrat spent a fortune crafting, and simply destroyed it to escape.<br /><br />"He doesn't usually brute force his way out of these. Is something wrong?"<br /><br />It was a change that only someone who had constantly seen Robin slip through his fingers would notice.<br />The prince gave chase to Robin. Every remnant of an act of violence he discovered made him ever more worried.<br /><br />During this chase, Robin entered a massive ruin on the Aldana continent. He made it past every trap with ease, and soon found the ruin's core power source. But what awaited him was a massive armed security droid. The droid's assault was ruthless, keeping Robin completely ont he defensive. But Robin could feel the power welling within him. He was aware that it was the Ark's power, the thing responsible for provoking his destructive impulses. But being aware of it didn't mean he could suppress its demands.<br /><br />When Robin unleashed the Ark's power, the tables immediately turned. He dodged the droid's attacks with his now-superhuman speed and destroyed it with a brutal series of strikes. But destroying the droid wasn't enough to placate the impulses the Ark had given him. Robin broke every part of the motionless droid into pieces. And once he finished, he turned his eyes to the ruin's core itself.<br />Destroying the core would cause an enormous explosion, turning the surrounding area into a wasteland.<br /><br />Robin was well aware of this. But his sense of reason could no longer exhibit any control over his body. He left himself to his impulses, wound up all the might he could muster, and struck at the core. But right then, someone appeared between him and the core and halted his attack.<br />It was the prince who had spent years trying to catch Robin.<br /><br />Robin was surprised at the unexpected intruder, but with his impulses nowhere near under control, he shifted his savage attacks to the prince.<br /><br />But the prince didn't dodge or defend himself. He took the attacks without flinching and simply stomped toward Robin. By the time Robin noticed that the prince was balling up a fist, it was already being driven into his face.<br /><br />"I expect better from the man I considered to be my lifelong rival! You really think you can score a cheap win in your beastly state?!"<br /><br />As Robin lay crumpled on the floor, the prince's words rang in his head before he lost consciousness.<br /><br />When Robin came to, the prince had already left. But Robin still remembered it all. The pain of the prince's punch. And the fury and disappointment in his eyes.<br /><br />"Tch... I'm pathetic. I can't believe I stopped being the kind of man who could win against you..."<br /><br />Once he finished sealing the ruin's core, Robin continued his thievery and his ruin exploration. But from then on, no matter how he used the Ark's power, he never let himself be consumed by his destructive impulses. Supposedly, it's because he regained his pride that he could remain who he was, as well as the willpower to fight against the Ark.
