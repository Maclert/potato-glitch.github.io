	<h4>Raging Beast</h4>
	<strong>Unlock at Lv2</strong>
	<br /><br />
	In the depths of a forest on the Aldana mainland, there was a village where Pokkle lived peacefully under the Elder Pokkle.<br />That village was home to Tera, Po, and Lara, three Pokkle children who were fast friends.<br /><br />One day, the trio journeyed far in search of an adventure. Po and Lara were excited by the new scenery, but not the timid Tera:<br />“Come on, guys! We should go back already.”<br /><br />Po and Lara giggled at Tera:<br />“Don’t be such a chicken!”<br />“Yeah! No one said we should only play near the village!”<br /><br />Unable to return alone, Tera tagged along. But as the group advanced, the earth began to rumble, catching even Po and Lara off guard:<br />“What’s happening?!”<br /><br />Suddenly, the rumbling stopped, and in the next moment, the children saw a tall tree torn down before their eyes. Behind it was a humongous Beast.<br />“Graaahhhh!”<br /><br />The plant-like Beast flailed its tangle of thick vines in the trio’s direction. At the tip of each vine were gaping, fang-packed jaws that could swallow little Pokkles in a singleg ulp.<br />“Whoa!”<br />“Help!”<br />“Oh, no!”<br /><br />The three were so frightened they couldn’t even run with their trembling legs. As the Beast was about to strike, a blinding beam of light surrounded the area. The next moment, the three children heard a voice crying out:<br />“Now is your chance to run!”<br /><br />Although dazzled by the bright light, Tera and friends gathered all their courage and ran towards the direction of the voice – a voice they recognized from somewhere before.<br /><br />– Excerpted from the fairy tale “Pokkle Village and the Raging Beast”

	<h4>Pokkle Eater</h4>
	<strong>Unlock at Lv4</strong>
	<br /><br />
	Dazzled by the light, Tera, Po and Lara closed their eyes and sprinted toward the voice, which came – surprisingly enough – from Elder Pokkle. Tera thanked the Elder for saving them:<br />“Thanks for saving us, Elder. But how did you know we were in danger?”<br />“Hohoho… to tell the truth, I came because I sensed a harmful presence. You just happened to be here.”<br /><br />Still somewhat startled, Lara immediately asked another question.<br />“So what was that big scary Beast anyway?”<br />“Humph… that horrible creature is the Pokkle Eater.”<br />The Elder explained that the Pokkle Eater was a semi-plant beast that had eaten many a Pokkle in the past.<br /><br />“What is such a horrible Beast doing here?” asked Tera, still in shock.<br />Po, in a sudden realization, said, “Is it here… because it’s heading for our village?”<br />“Y-you’re kidding, right? I mean, we’re quite far from the village. It must be a coincidence…” replied Lara, trying to deny what Po said.<br /><br />However, the Elder looked at the children with a stern expression and told them, “The Pokkle Eater is an expert at sniffing out our homes. I’m afraid it’s only a matter of time before it finds the village.”<br />“Oh no… everyone is danger!” exclaimed Tera, and the Elder agreed with a nod.<br />“We need to hurry. We must go back and tell everyone!”<br /><br />– Excerpted from the fairy tale “Pokkle Village and the Raging Beast”

	<h4>Resolute Trio</h4>
	<strong>Unlock at Lv7</strong>
	<br /><br />
	The villagers flew into a panic when the Elder told them about the Pokkle Eater because – unlike Tera, Po and Lara – the adults understood its terrifying nature.<br />“Where did it come from?” “It’s gonna eat us all up!”<br />“What in the world do we do…?!”<br /><br />Once the Elder calmed the Pokkle villagers, they discussed their ordeal until dawn. In the end, they decided to abandon the village and migrate elsewhere. Tera, Po and Lara – who were children and weren’t allowed to join the discussion – couldn’t accept the conclusion.<br />“We can’t just leave our village!”<br />“All we have to do is defeat the Beast!”<br />“Yeah! Come on!”<br /><br />However, the adults had no interest in listening. The trio were scolded for their disobedience, and even the Elder asked them to cooperate.<br />“I can understand why you object, but we must face facts. We are Pokkle, and that Beast is a Pokkle Eater. We’re simply helpless before it.”<br /><br />All the same, Tera and friends had no intention to go along with the plans. That’s when Po made a suggestion:<br />“We should go take down the Beast by ourselves!”<br />To this Lara instantly agreed, saying, “Yes! If the adults won’t do anything, we’ll have to save the day!”<br /><br />Po and Lara both looked at Tera and awaited his response. Despite his usual contrariness, he quickly agreed.<br />“Yeah… let’s do it! If we put our strength together, we can beat the Beast!”<br /><br />– Excerpted from the fairy tale “Pokkle Village and the Raging Beast”

	<h4>Little Heroes</h4>
	<strong>Unlock at Lv10</strong>
	<br /><br />
	Determined to battle the Pokkle Eater, Tera, Po and Lara planned an ambush – their one hope of emerging from battle victorious. The three clutched their homemade weapons as they lay in wait for the beast, each struggling to keep their fear in check.<br /><br />And the moment came. The earth rumbled, and the Pokkle Eater suddenly came into sight. Tera and friends rushed the Beast, plunging their weapons into its body. Their ambush was a success!<br /><br />Or so it seemed for a moment, until the Pokkle Eater whipped the young trio with its vines.<br />“Whoa!”<br />“Owww!”<br />“Eeeeeek!”<br /><br />The hulking Pokkle Eater thundered towards the three children, who appeared altogether too delicious to let them escape. The mouths at the end of the Beast’s vines opened wide, as if to gobble them up.<br /><br />Paralyzed with fear, Po and Lara were unable to do so much as speak. Little Tera alone was able to raise his weapon and cry out in a trembling voice,<br />“W-we won’t lose! Not to the likes of you!”<br /><br />Suddenly, an orb of light pierced the trees and made impact with the Pokkle Eater.<br />“Grrrraahhh!” wailed the Beast.<br /><br />Standing between the Pokkle Eater and the children was the Elder Pokkle.<br />“What are you runts thinking, taking on this monster alone!”<br />“Elder, it’s you!”<br /><br />To the surprise of Tera and his friends, the Elder was joined by Pokkle villagers, who swarmed the Pokkle Eater from every direction and attacked.<br />“Why are THEY here?”<br />“Your bravery spurred the villagers into action – and I am no exception!” said the Elder. The Elder raised his faithful rod to issue a command to the other Pokkles. “We shall rise up to protect our land! Attaaaaack!”<br /><br />The Pokkle Eater tried to swat back the Pokkle masses with its vines, but the lumbering beast could not contend with their sheer numbers. Seeing this, Tera, Po and Lara looked each other in the eyes, and courage welled up within them a second time.<br />“Now’s our chance!”<br />“Let’s do it!”<br />“No monster’s gonna beat us!”<br /><br />Homemade weapons in hand, the three charged at the Pokkle Eater and pierced its soft spot.<br />“Grrraaahhhh!”<br />Even a giant Beast like the Pokkle Eater couldn’t help but roar when struck somewhere so delicate. It fled as far from the village as it could at breakneck speed. The Pokkles cried out with joy, for they had defended their home with their own hands.<br /><br />With everyone gathered into a circle, the Elder told Tera and friends to step forward.<br />“Tera, Po and Lara, you were the Pokkles who made this victory possible. Everyone, praise the little heroes for their bravery!”<br />“Hip-hip-hooraaaaay!”<br /><br />Though they squirmed with embarrassment, the three children were secretly delighted to be praised as never before.<br />“Anyone could’ve done it.”<br />“Yeah, that’s right.”<br />“Uh-huh. It wasn’t a big deal.”<br />Despite the humility of the trio – or perhaps because of it – cheers rang out through the forest for a long time afterward. <br />– Excerpted from the fairy tale “Pokkle Village and the Raging Beast”<br /><br />The fairy tale “Pokkle Village and the Raging Beast” was originally recorded by Dion, a Pokkle researcher and folklorist. His many works on Pokkles are beloved by children of all ages, though they are occasionally criticized for anthropomorphizing the Pokkle – an issue that the author has himself acknowledged.<br />However, not all of Dion’s writings are pure fiction. For example, the Pokkle Eater of the story is an actually existing natural predator of Pokkles, and in a few documented cases, Pokkles have cooperated to defeat it. In that sense, Dion’s works represent an enchanting mix of imagination and fact.
