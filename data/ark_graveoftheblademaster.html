	<h4>The Death of a Blademaster</h4>
	<strong>Unlock at Lv2</strong>
	<br /><br />
	Who could’ve imagined that even a master swordsman like you could die?<br />As you expanded the territory of the Holy Odal Kingdom, you defeated an enemy kingdom’s conjurer, earning yourself the title of master swordsman.<br />You sacrificed your own life to protect your people.<br />How will they take the news of your death? You were always thinking of your country, vowing to protect it along with its future, so perhaps this was not the worst way for you to go… Perhaps.<br /><br />As you were overwhelmed and fatally wounded by the might of a Beast, you said these final words to me:<br />“I’ll hold this monster back! Pierce through my flesh and kill it!”<br />But I lacked the resolve to wield my spear as you asked. You had once saved my life from a Beast who tried to kill me, and then you mentored me up until this very moment.<br />How could I possibly pierce through you with my own hands?<br />Now that I think about it, you were always worried about my weakness of heart, weren’t you? Even as I stand before your grave today, all I can think about is… if only I had been stronger, I wouldn’t have let you die.<br /><br />– Sigulus, before the grave of the master swordsman

	I remember how surprised I was when you told me of the life you led before we met. You called your past self the King of the Countryside. I laughed.<br />I knew you as someone who could defeat Beasts in hand-to-hand combat, so to this very day, I still cannot imagine you as someone so arrogant. After all, to me, you were someone who knew the extent of his own power and never took personal offence to his enemies.<br />That’s the sort of seasoned warrior I knew you to be.<br /><br />That’s why I couldn’t believe my ears when you told me you’d once been utterly defeated by that conjurer and barely escaped alive.<br />I still cannot believe it.<br />Regardless, you stood up, looked at your failures, and journeyed from place to place to polish your swordsmanship. You overcame the conjurer who had once defeated you and earned your rightful title. Hearing your story filled my heart with a burning passion I can still remember today. Perhaps that was a sign that what you were saying was true.<br /><br />I want to tell others more about you. Your war with the conjurer. The signature abilities that you created. Your sword-fighting style, perfected through the course of your journey.<br />I have inherited at least some of your skills, haven’t I?

	<h4>Memories of the Blademaster</h4>
	<strong>Unlock at Lv7</strong>
	<br /><br />
	I’ll never forget the day I met you.<br />I had been cornered by a Beast that had attacked me near one of the towns by the border, and was knocking on death’s door.<br />The Beast’s sharp claws would have killed me had you not blocked them. The sheer emotion I felt as my life was saved by a nationally renowned master swordsman will be with me for the rest of my life.<br />If it were not for the training and mentorship you gave me from that day forward, I likely would’ve perished long ago, a forgotten body among many on some battlefield.<br />Looking back, your training was always harsh. You pointed to a rock and told me to smash it. I thought you were joking. You always confused me when you’d say, “Try to land a single hit” during sparring matches.<br /><br />While your methods of teaching me to wield a blade were harsh, I always felt you were gentle with your guidance.<br />When I fell asleep, exhausted from the strain of training, you would kindly cook me a nourishing meal for when I woke up. And in your final moments, you desperately held back the Beast from moving.<br />I owe you my life several times over.

	<h4>A Grave Vow</h4>
	<strong>Unlock at Lv10</strong>
	<br /><br />
	All of your teachings are etched into my heart.<br />Strength belongs not to the strong, but to the weak whom they must protect. When you cross blades with someone, always look at them with respect, never down upon them with disgust.<br />If a friend entrusts their life to you, you must protect them until the very end.<br />I live my life based on these principles and promise to uphold them in battle.<br />I swear upon your sword and my spear that I will dedicate my life to protecting this nation and its citizens, just as you have before me.<br />I shall wield this spear to protect as many lives as you would have. No, even more than that.<br />So please… rest in peace, and watch over this land as its citizens live in peace.<br /><br />With these final words, Sigulus pierces the master swordsman’s sword into his gravestone and leaves.<br />It is said that Sigulus would later become sharper and more skilled as he continued to eliminate Beasts and save the innocent.
