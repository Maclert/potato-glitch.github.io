	<h4>Heart of a Thief</h4>
	<strong>Unlock at Lv10</strong>
	<br /><br />
	There was once a thief who stole treasure out of ruins and from the rich across the land. There are various theories about his origins, but many suspect he came from the Holy Kingdom, since that is where references to him first appear. At the time the gap between the nobility, commoners and the poor was steadily growing. Robin stole from the rich and gave what he took to the poor, which has led some to believe that he came from a poor family himself.<br /><br />He carried out more heists than can be recounted here. The generosity of his thievery made him beloved by the public and led to many stories and legends that would cement his popularity over the ages.<br /><br />According to one story he stopped by a town while on the run after a robbery. There, a villager asked why he targeted the nobility, since they kept such strict watch over their valuables. He replied thusly:<br />"Seeing people take joy in hoarding riches for themselves makes me sick to my stomach. I want to teach them that life will come back to bite them."<br /><br />There is also the famous line he once told to a nobleman who captured him:<br />"It's an 'easy come, easy go' world, right? You use your power and riches to trick people out of their money. But it's gonna get taken right back to people like me if you're not careful."<br /><br />He was truly a thief for the people.<br /><br />At the same time, he loved rare treasure and seemed to take real joy in stealing it. Some of his favorite pieces were a crystal known as the Mermaid's Tear, the Mask of the Eternal Smile, and the original copy of Requiem of the Goddess.

	<h4>Gorde Prison</h4>

	<br /><br />
	Amongst the many legends about Robin are a perpetually popular series depicting Robin's back-and-forth with an extremely wealthy king who made his fortune in a generation thanks to the Mines of Gorde. His targets are normally depicted as bad guys, but in this case the king treated his people well and was beloved rather than detested.<br />However, Robin stole things again and again from him nonetheless, with the king preparing all sorts of traps to catch him only to be foiled each time.<br /><br />No one knows why Robin went after him so many times, but the king once wrote,<br />"Robin is the only one strong enough to pose a true challenge to me," suggesting a complicated relationship of mutual respect rather than pure animosity.<br /><br />One of Robin's most brilliant feats of their rivalry is captured in the story of 'The Gorde Prison.' In the story, the rich king is finally successful in capturing Robin and confines him in a huge prison that he built specifically for the famous thief. Robin was trapped. The king, filled with joy over his accomplishment, proceeded to throw a grand banquet to celebrate.<br /><br />But that wasn't the end! Robin managed to steal the very prison he was in and escape the king's clutches once again. It was just as they said, "There is nothing he can't steal."<br />Needless to say, the wealthy king was vexed beyond words. How Robin went about stealing the entire prison remains a mystery.

	<h4>Questionable Behavior</h4>

	<br /><br />
	Opinions vary on how exactly Robin used the riches he stole from nobility. Both the legends and historical records tell how he walked through the streets offering it to the poor, of course, but taking a closer look this wouldn't account for the total sum of everything he stole. He didn't leave behind any inheritance when he passed away, so he must have used it all up at some point.<br /><br />How then did Robin use his amassed fortune? The writings of the wealthy head of the Gorde Mines help to fill in the cracks left by stories and national records. He writes that Robin used his resources to explore ancient ruins. The wealthy man had begun visiting the ruins himself at some point, and in his detailed records he explains that was how he discovered what Robin was doing. It was not his intention to chase Robin into the ruins.<br /><br />We do know for a fact that Robin traveled to ancient ruins in search of treasure and vied with a certain swordswoman to reach the treasure first. No one knows why he sought the treasureâ€”some say it was his typical curiosity while others suggest it was part of a broader plan.<br /><br />According to other sources the woman with whom he fought was trying to protect the treasures. This theory makes out Robin to be a disruptive figure in the ruins, although the writings of the wealthy head of the mines suggest that this was not the case.

	<h4>Another Hidden Face</h4>

	What was the wealthy man trying to convey through his writings after he began visiting the sites of ancient ruins? The overwhelming majority of them deal with a swordswoman who appeared in the ruins. In fact, one can gather that he was visiting the ruins for the sole purpose of encountering the woman. The circumstances under which the two first met is currently a topic of research.<br />His thorough records of the woman include times when he witnessed interactions between her and Robin.<br />The two vied for treasure at times, but in other cases the wealthy man writes that they fought alongside one another. Thus it seems that the two were not entirely at odds with each other.<br /><br />His writings also mention times when all three of them joined forces to fight together. However, he only records what happened each day without any mention of what led up to that point, leaving researchers to speculate about each of their motives and causing many heated discussions. The documents also tell us that Robin's activities came to an end when he perished in a fight in the ruins, and that he devoted his entire life to the very end trying to help others.<br /><br />It is as yet unclear why he ventured to so many ruins. Further research is needed not only into his life, but also that of the swordswoman and the wealthy man in order to fully resolve the mysterious that surround him.
