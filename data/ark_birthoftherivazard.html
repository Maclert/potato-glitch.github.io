	<h4>Symbol of Strength</h4>
	<strong>Unlock at Lv2</strong>
	<br /><br />
	Vazards are half-man, half-serpent beasts whose humanoid intelligence enables them to speak in the tongues of mankind. These creatures inhabit every corner of Granzelia, but their moral code remains remarkably consistent throughout: above all else they value strength, and any who are sufficiently powerful will win their due respect. This apotheosis of might inclines Vazards toward aggression and the settlement of disputes in battle; as a result, humans tend not to mingle with Vazards. Consequently, much of Vazard culture and ecology has long been shrouded in mystery. Since the great Tamara lived among the Vazards, however, she was able to elucidate many aspects of the beasts’ life cycle and customs for the first time. The discoveries that resulted from her germinal research into the Rivazard were long a topic of fierce discussion for magizoologists.<br /><br />The Rivazards are also half-man, half-serpent animals, but whereas the Vazards’ scales are blue, the Rivazards’ are golden. The Rivazard’s prowess also far outstrips that of the Vazard. For that reason, some observers have speculated that the Rivazard may be a mutation or genealogical relative of the standard Vazard; however, this is contradicted by Tamara’s reportage that Vazards become Rivazards after undertaking a ceremony. This ritual is a privilege afforded to only the greatest warriors, making it a supreme honor in a society that values might above all else.

	<h4>Light to True Power</h4>

	The standards by which a Vazard becomes a Rivazard have purportedly changed throughout the ages, but strength has always been one constant. In the past, practically only historic figures of towering achievement have become Rivazards, which testifies to the great difficulty of their tasks. Once a Vazard has own the right to become a Rivazard, he must still proceed through a series of mandated steps. After receiving a recommendation from a village elder, a Rivazard’s personality, prowess, and other such characteristics are judged by Vazard chieftains from the surrounding lands. Should he be deemed truly worthy, he is led to a temple wherein the rite takes place.<br /><br />Admitted Vazards first travel to the relevant holy site, and once there imbibe a liquor that shimmers gold. They are then presented with a special weapon that is inlayed with the bones of former Rivazards. The Vazard lets its own blood flow onto the weapon – said to harbor the Rivazard’s soul – and by doing so forms a pact with its predecessor. Following this, the Vazard climbs onto the altar and is bathed in the divine sunlight, which turns its blue scales gold. When the researcher Tamara first witnessed the birth of a Rivazard, she described it as so beautifully kaleidoscopic that it was nearly ineffable.

	<h4>Dark to False Power</h4>

	During the Rivazard initiation, there have been a number of unusual occurrences.<br /><br />Once, the Vazard known as Baizaal was a candidate to become a Rivazard. He was so strong as to return alive from the most challenging of battles, and yet he was gentle and beloved by those around him. When a village elder recommended that he be made into a Rivazard, the surrounding chieftains unanimously agreed. They expected him to be the greatest Rivazard of the decade – but the ceremony was interrupted with an unprecedented happening.<br /><br />After quaffing down the spirits with alacrity, Baizaal stepped up on the altar and prepared to seal a blood pact with the designated weapon. But astonishingly, he began to writhe in pain when the sunlight did not begold him. As the attendees flew into a commotion, the officiating Vazard elder glowered at the charred, slumped-over figure and spoke.<br /><br />“He was incinerated because one so unqualified could not help but enrage the Rivazard’s soul!”<br /><br />The Rivazard ritual had dual purposes: the first being to grant power to those who deserve it, and the other to punish those who do not. In the end it became clear that Baizaal had long deceived his associates and achieved his goals through underhanded methods – his amiability was in the end little more than a facade. The Vazard chieftains were irate at the would-be initiate and demanded that he make amends with his life. The elder stopped them though, reminding the others that for a Vazard, the greatest punishment was to live in shame.<br /><br />Never again was Baizaal able to show his face in the sun, and for the remainder of his days he would live with the contempt of his kin.

	<h4>Heroes of Gold</h4>
	<strong>Unlock at Lv10</strong>
	<br /><br />
	The storied history of the Vazards tells of many heroes, and the majority of these are said to have been Rivazards. The most distinguished of all was perhaps the one called Go’uin.<br /><br />While the ilk of Lougseus invaded settlements in the north of the Aldanian mainland, the Vazards throughout neighboring lands banded together to resist. At first the two armies clashed around Mount Gragia. When the battle began, the forces of the God of Ruin were in an overwhelmingly powerful position. But at last, one great individual stood on the front lines to rally the troops: Go’uin.<br /><br />Like some mad god he felled one Lougseusean after another, his golden scales bathed in blood, glimmering in the sun and lifting the spirits of his compatriots. Eventually, the Vazard army succeeded at beating back the opponents. Even when compared to the other front-line combatants, Go’uin’s scales shoen as brilliantly as the daybreak. Radiance is commonly said to be an indicator of a Rivazard’s strength, growing brighter as might increases. During the battle, Go’uin’s shimmer was said to be supremely reflective as a consequence of the encouragement that he had received.<br /><br />According to the researcher Tamara, it’s said that by means of a certain ceremony, some Rivazards are able to change into Mirrovazards with mirrorlike scales, Gilguazards with abnormally large claws and fangs, and winged L’vazards that transcend what people normally think of as Rivazards. If her research is able to progress further, she may discover as yet unknown varieties of Vazard.
