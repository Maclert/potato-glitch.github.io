	<h4>101: A Beastly History</h4>
	<strong>Unlock at Lv2</strong>
	<br /><br />
	This lecture will focus on an ancient era long before the war with the God of Ruin – a time when man and Beast did not yet understand one another.<br /><br />In the past, Beasts were seen as the enemy. They were to be killed before they could kill. Such was the age of Beast hunters, those who specialized in defeating these Beasts.<br />Many famous Beast hunters’ names and legacies are remembered even to this day, so it shouldn’t be too difficult to imagine.<br /><br />While Beast hunters may have specialized in the subjugation of Beasts, the technology available to them was far more primitive than it is today, and as such, they fought with crude weapons. Nevertheless, they relied on their bravery and fought Beasts several times their own size.<br /><br />Before the appearance of Beast hunters, people would defeat monsters with sheer numbers, brute force, and traps. In a sense, it was as if humans used their wits to compensate for primitive weaponry.<br />However, after many, many battles, humans eventually found the Beasts’ strengths, their weaknesses, and their limitations. The benefits of fighting skill became apparent. Humanity’s previous method of fighting Beasts began to change. No longer did everyone, warrior or otherwise, have to fight.<br />Those confident in their fighting prowess organized themselves and offered their services. And thus came the age where arms were taken up only by those who wished to hone their skills.<br /><br />Eventually, people began to fight monsters on their own. Those who excelled in battle praised each other’s accomplishments. No longer were they merely fighting Beasts to protect humanity; they were fighting for glory, to see who could take down the strongest Beasts.<br />This is the origin of the Beast hunter.<br /><br />Our next lecture will focus on the life of a Beast hunter.<br /><br />– Excerpt from a Beast scholar’s lecture.

	The collection of Beast hunters, confident in their abilities, gradually formed a hierarchy based on the number of Beasts hunted.<br />Allow me to use this lecture to highlight the activities of one particularly proficient hunter.<br /><br />It was his skills in archery that set this hunter apart from the rest. The bows of his time were crude, and it was particularly difficult to increase their accuracy. Therefore, archery was thought of as useless beyond its capacity to threaten or reduce mobility, and it was therefore largely ignored.<br /><br />Nevertheless, this man went against the grain and honed his archery skills, making him capable of felling enemies at a distance far quicker than his contemporaries. He succeeded in hunt after hunt, earning a solid reputation.<br /><br />His hunting exploits garnered him fame, and it is even said that he hunted gargantuan Beasts on a certain island. These Beasts were dozens of times his size, with enormous wings, and had apparently killed many a hunter.<br />Factoring in the Beasts’ wingspan, he carefully chose his position, and shot the Beasts’ weak spots with his bow. He slew them all with nary an arrow wasted.<br /><br />There have been many hunters like him who earned a name for themselves, but hunters lead hard lives where it’s always kill or be killed.<br />Our next lecture will focus on a failure that led to a paradigm shift in the world of hunters.<br /><br />– Excerpt from a Beast scholar’s lecture.

	As the days of Beast hunting continued, it seems some people came to change their views about Beasts.<br />For this lecture, I shall talk about how the hunter mentality has changed over time.<br /><br />One day, a certain hunter had failed his hunt and sustained a heavy injury. As he limped back to his hometown, he ran out of strength and collapsed. It was then that a never-before-seen Beast appeared and began treating the hunter’s wounds.<br />The Beast must have had some botanical knowledge, as it used nearby plants as medicine to treat him.<br /><br />The hunter was surprised by the monster’s actions, but as his body could not move, he could do nothing but watch silently as the Beast went about its treatment. By the time the hunter’s wounds had healed and he could stand, he decided to try talking with it.<br /><br />“Why did you treat me, a human?”<br /><br />The Beast answered that it hated conflict and could not leave a living being to suffer, be they Beast or human.<br />Upon hearing those words, something inside the hunter change. Until that moment, he had been driven by the feeling that all Beasts were enemies.<br /><br />Our next lecture will focus on how this event inspired the hunter to change his ways, and exactly what changed. Now, these hunter anecdotes I cover in my lectures have been recorded by Lanzelian scholars in a book called “History of the Beast Hunters”. If anyone is interested in further reading, I would highly recommend this work.<br /><br />— Excerpt from a Beast scholar’s lecture.

	<h4>104: What True Peace Looks Like</h4>

	<br /><br />
	In our last lecture, we discussed how a Beast saved a hunter’s life, thus changing the hunter’s lifelong animosity toward Beasts. Let us continue from where we left off.<br /><br />Allegedly, the hunter suggested that the Beast who saved him should use his botanical knowledge to treat more of mankind.<br />While the Beast was glad to help those suffering in front of him, he did not want to do something so grandiose and apparently refused. However, the hunter would not back down. He desperately pleaded with the Beast, telling him how thankful he was for being saved.<br />He expressed his desire to eliminate the distance between man and Beast, and how he wanted the races to rise above their animosity.<br /><br />His passionate appeal convinced the Beast to accept his proposal, and thus the Beast began treating the wounds and illnesses of people living in the hunter’s village. The villagers expressed their gratitude, but those in neighboring areas who heard tell of the Beast and his deeds had mixed responses.<br /><br />Some came to the Beast for treatment of their own illnesses, treating him amicably. Others, bound to tradition, feared the Beast and kept their distance.<br />Despite this, the Beast had the support of the hunter who had brought him there, and so their cordial relationship continued.<br /><br />Neither friendliness nor fear were wholly unreasonable, as there are indeed Beasts who cause measurable harm to humanity. Nevertheless, the relationship between the hunter and the Beast became a symbol of a new sort of peace, and significant enough that their story persists to this day.<br /><br />I implore everyone attending this lecture to reflect on how you personally interact with Beasts. Think of this as a step toward a better future for us both.<br />Thank you for listening.<br /><br />– Excerpt from a Beast scholar’s lecture.
