	<h4>Missing Person</h4>
	<strong>Unlock at Lv2</strong>
	<br /><br />
	I suppose this is somewhat of a diary. Considering the nature of what I intend to investigate, it is not inconceivable that I may find myself in mortal danger.<br />I write with the hope that leaving these notes behind will serve, in and of itself, as a form of insurance.<br />The target of my upcoming investigation is the White Laboratory.<br />Most people have probably never even heard the name. I myself was only made aware of its existence when I was following up an old case of mass disappearances.<br /><br />In the age when the God of Ruin ruled over Granzelia, the continents were governed by the Holy Odal Kingdom, the Lanzelia Kingdom, and the Mordana Kingdom. In each, a suspicious amount of disappearances occurred.<br />At the time, the God of Ruin’s rule was tyrannical, and it was an everyday occurrence for those who committed acts of rebellion to be carried off by its followers. In other words, it was not uncommon for people to go missing.<br /><br />However, this case was very different because of its scale. The number of missing in each kingdom was said to be in the hundreds, and some of these people had allegedly dropped off the map of their own accord.<br />The rulers of the kingdoms ordered their subordinates to investigate, but they could not find the missing people. As the number of incidents tapered off, the case was left unsolved. As it piqued my interest, I looked over the documents from that time and traced the footsteps of those who had gone missing from the three kingdoms. At last, I determined that the place they were taken to (or perhaps willingly agreed to go to) was a place called the White Laboratory.<br /><br />– Writing to you from Roland’s castle town, Reporter Zeul for “Varium Monthly”

	<h4>The White Laboratory</h4>
	<strong>Unlock at Lv4</strong>
	<br /><br />
	The White Laboratory… Although it is never referred to in official documents, there are several accounts of what appears to be such an organization left in various unofficial personal notes.<br />According to these records, its establishment can be traced back to the distant past, even before the God of Ruin’s world domination.<br />The very first reference I could find to the White Laboratory is in the notes of Darus, the man who surveyed the continents. In fact, it is because of him that we can attribute the name, “White Laboratory”.<br />According to his notes, he once came upon a mysterious group who were investigating the flotsam and jetsam that came from ancient civilizations and other worlds. These strange people were all dressed in the same white clothes. On top of that, since they insisted that their research was “pure”, he gave their organization the name of “White Laboratory”.<br />It is unclear what happened between Darus and these people from White Laboratory, but after he returned from his chartering trip, he saw unnatural success in life, even beyond that warranted by his achievements.<br /><br />When I sent the above article to “Varium Monthly”, I received a response from the editor-in-chief, ordering me to discontinue my investigation. Of course, I inquired as to why, but received no specific reason.<br />I’ve already come so far, I cannot possibly quit now. I will not be satisfied until I have found some sort of “answer”.<br />Since beginning my investigation, I have had the strange sense that someone is watching me. There have been no signs of anyone following me, so perhaps it is just my imagination…?<br /><br />– Writing to you from Mordana Port, Reporter Zeul for “Varium Monthly”

	<h4>Artificial Deification Project</h4>
	<strong>Unlock at Lv7</strong>
	<br /><br />
	What exactly is being researched in the White Laboratory? Much of it is shrouded in mystery, and even after all my investigations, it is difficult to elucidate. Still, if you consider that it has been connected to a large number of missing persons’ cases, is it not obvious that they are undertaking something inhumane?<br /><br />I have at last been successful in getting my hands on information regarding one of the laboratory’s projects. Its title is the “Artificial God Project”.<br /><br />Using technology, they forcibly increased the life force within human children, or even babies, thereby giving them the power of gods, or some equivalent.<br />However, life force is difficult to control, and the project was ultimately a failure. It seems they were unable to bring into being even one child with the power of a god.<br /><br />However, as a byproduct, they created several magic spirits. The so-called “flame demon” that lived in the Malboria Lava Caves was one such spirit.<br />I also obtained information more shocking than anything previously uncovered: the White Laboratory, believed to be a relic from the past no longer in existence, is actually still in operation today.<br />The descendants of those who once belonged to, and worked for the laboratory, must still be around somewhere. At least, that’s what I’ve assumed until now.<br />Thinking that they would not appreciate my investigations, I have been leaving memorandums like this one for my own self protection.<br />But I never imagined that the organization itself was still in existence. I am due to meet shortly with someone who has valuable information on this matter. I’m sure they will reveal a truth to me that could turn the world upside down.<br />My hands are shaking with anticipation.<br /><br />– Writing to you from the lively town of Badaal,<br />Freelance Writer Zeul

	<h4>Incident Report</h4>
	<strong>Unlock at Lv10</strong>
	<br /><br />
	A man named Zeul from the Imperial Capital Aldana was staying in room 203 of the Bird’s Nest Inn in southern Badaal. According to the proprietor, he did not cause any trouble and paid all his fees upfront. However, during the third night of his sojourn, a loud noise like something collapsing was heard from his room.<br />When the proprietor rushed in to see what had happened, he found Zeul’s body lying on the floor. Upon further examination of the body, no external wounds were found.<br />Also in the room were two teacups: one Zeul’s, and one presumed to be that of a visitor. However, according to the proprietor, Zeul had seen no visitors to his room that evening.<br />A memorandum was also found in his room, which formed the basis of his investigative report on the White Laboratory. While some parts seemed to be missing, the account stated that he believed his life could be at risk due to the investigation he was conducting.<br />If Zeul was murdered with squandering his investigation as the motive, then why would the culprit leave behind such a vital clue?<br /><br />The editorial department of the magazine Zeul wrote for revealed he had previously been dismissed due to the nonsensical nature of his writings and his inability to distinguish between fantasy and reality.<br />Was this investigation merely another one of his delusions? It is not my job to make the judgment, and so I close this investigation.<br /><br />While many unanswered questions remain, I deem this incident not to be of a criminal nature.<br />I believe Zeul died of natural causes. I have enclosed his memorandum with this report.<br />I will leave judgments of its contents up to the imperial government.<br /><br />– A report regarding the untimely death that occurred at the Bird’s Nest Inn in Badaal,<br />Badaal Royal Guard Riml
