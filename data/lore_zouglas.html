	<h4>Lord of Ruin</h4>
	<strong>Unlock at Lv10</strong>
	<br /><br />
	Of the loyal followers of Lougseus, a small entourage is known as the Four Lords of Ruin.<br /><br />The name has been known since the time the God of Ruin had been running rampant through Granzelia. The hands that crush the ones that rebel against the God of Ruin.<br />Zouglas especially took it upon himself to weed out the rebels and anyone that did not devote themselves to a similar degree. Whether it was his own family or a village of innocents, it didn’t matter. Anyone that had potential was put up to his trial of proving their loyalty, himself included. But his methods were not sneaky or underhanded. He preferred to utterly crush their spines, along with their hopes and dreams. So naturally, he made a name for himself to the point where his name was nearly synonymous to fear for anyone that dared to stand up against the God of Ruin.<br /><br />His fearsome power was unmatched during the war. Zouglas was a commander for Lougseus’ forces, capturing a number of enemy bases and leaving behind a trail of corpses.<br /><br />Eventually the war subsided, ending with the God of Ruin being sealed away. At the same time the Four Deities seemingly vanished from existence with their lord. Since then, Zouglas has laid low along with the rest of the Four Deities, waiting for the return of Lougseus. But in recent years his activity has been witnessed again, with the occasional report of classified facilities throughout Aldana and Blaze being torn down by a single being in a suit of armor.

	<h4>Tragedy of Bjozir</h4>
	<strong>Unlock at Lv30</strong>
	<br /><br />
	An anecdote about the Tragedy of Bjozir shows just how terrifying Zouglas was throughout Lanzelia.<br />Bjozir is the name of the area just west of the Lanzelian Snow Fields, during which elite Aldanian troops were wiped out one by one by Zouglas during the great war.<br /><br />It started as an operation to send a large-scale Lougseusian army to the Arden Border to seize Aldana. Upon hearing about the plans, the people of Lanzelia sent extra troops tot he fort to prevent the invasion. This battle went down in history as the Battle of the Arden Border. The clash of the forces that took place undoubtedly influenced the great war and sealed the fate of the goddess that took part in it. As a result, the troops there were considered elite and had high morale.<br /><br />However, Russel Parker, one of the soldiers that managed to survive, recalls the following:<br />“When we left the castle, we were sent off with the cheering of citizens. We were excited to be a part of history, passionate to defend the country from the God of Ruin. Nobody feared battle. …But that was all we thought until that place.”<br /><br />The troops had started making their way through the blizzard to Port Kandra. Of course, the snowstorm threw them off course and the troops were nearing Bjozir. Through the snow, they could all see that there was a blurred figure ahead of them. A rock or a person that could potentially be in need. The commander at the time, Sergei Turners, had sent out scouts to find out who or what it was.<br /><br />Little did the troops know, the man there had an iron grip on their fate.

	Russel Parker recalls those memories:<br /><br />“In the beginning, we didn’t know what was ahead. Whether they were suspicious or not. Commander Turners had given orders to stop and sent out several scouts to find out. But I could’ve sworn, as soon as they approached the blurry figure, they were decapitated. Their blood went everywhere. I’m sure some others had seen as well, but we were too stunned to move.<br />However, Commander Turners was faster than all of us, immediately instructing the archer to take aim.<br />Then, we knew, that was an “Enemy”.<br />That power… It was nothing that we could’ve expected. I doubt the Commander knew about it as well. But as soon as the archer had released the arrow, the figure plunged that huge sword into the ground. The impact from the shockwave shook the ground, even if it was covered in snow. We all lost our footing for a moment, of course we did. And all of a sudden, that figure was amongst us, that sword swinging sideways. All of our archers were cut in half in a split second.<br /><br />With our long-ranged archers defeated, I knew exactly who it was. That jet-black armor that even swallowed light. I never thought I’d feel that much fear in my life. That man was extraordinary in a number of ways, but… everything was too late.”<br /><br />Zouglas had taken down Sergei Turner’s men in a blink of an eye and the commander himself was the only one able to land a single blow on Zouglas. And in that one blow, Sergei had been knocked to the ground, left there to die in the snow with a gaping wound. Soldiers continued to fall, one after another.<br />Russel Parker stood on shaking legs, trying to stand up against Zouglas. At just the right time his legs gave way, as Zouglas’ sword clashed with his, sending Russel flying. He crashed into a tree and promptly lost consciousness upon impact.<br /><br />Later, when he woke, what laid in front of Russel was previously white snow, dyed crimson by the blood of his comrades. Russel Parker had become the sole survivor of the Tragedy of Bjozir, the sole survivor that had witnessed just how horrifying Zouglas’ power could be.<br /><br />“I will never forget that. Their expressions of agony frozen in the ice. A handful of them were cut cleanly in two.<br />…We were all boasting the idea that we would return as heroes because we had turned the tides. I can’t fight against them anymore. I don’t want to die!”<br /><br />And so, the Tragedy fo Bjozir recorded the utter decimation of reinforcements from Lanzelia. It goes without saying that the battle of the Arden Border had become more ill-fated than before.

	<h4>Human Analysis</h4>
	<strong>Unlock at Lv80</strong>
	<br /><br />
	Zouglas was well-known for terrorizing citizens, but some have made him the subject of their studies since the war.<br /><br />For instance, several witnesses claim that they saw him before and during the war, visiting places that held no value to the God of Ruin.<br />Many speculate that it is a direct order from Lougseus and that he was not there for personal reasons, if he were to still be considered as a human. They theorize the order may be to go directly to the fissure that leads to the other world and destroy anything that comes through it. Some even say there is a man in the Lougseusian forces that uses heavy weapons from that world. Piercing through the armor while staying a safe distance away, leaving magic and archery as the only options to go against that man. If they side with the God of Ruin, it appears as though they were fine witht he ones that made it to this world.<br /><br />Additionally, Lougseus and the Four Deities are said to be utterly above mankind in terms of lifespan, power, and understanding of the world around them. The Four Deities have been there ever since the ancient legends of Lougseus have been present.<br />However, some even wonder if the name “Zouglas” is more of a title and position within the Four Deities, rather than a single and seemingly omnipotent being. If that theory were to be true, once the old “Zouglas” had stepped down (or most likely met an untimely end), a new one would be chosen to taken on the name. Of course, this idea would apply to the other three.<br />The reason for this theory is because the fact that there are tales in which Zouglas has been seen favoring a different sword and his fighting style was undeniably different from more recent tales.<br />It is said that during the war, he was much crueler to mankind, making the “current” Zouglas humane in comparison.<br /><br />If the theory holds true, then who is currently within the suit of armor?
