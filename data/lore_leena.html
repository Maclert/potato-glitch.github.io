	<h4>Invitation to Yggdrasil</h4>
	<strong>Unlock at Lv10</strong>
	<br /><br />
	Leena is known as 'The Maiden of Yggdrasil,' a young girl able to communicate with monsters. She is one of the heroes who fought against the God of Ruin during his Great War on Humanity, using tree magic and songs of healing.<br />Born in a village near Fairies Forest on the Island of Migal, Leena was gifted in magic from a very young age.<br />Children of the village would often spot fairies in that location, but Leena saw them more frequently than others. She could also understand their thoughts, and even communicate with them to a limited degree.<br />"I can't really explain it... I can just understand them somehow," she would tell others.<br /><br />One day when she was 10, Leena suddenly went missing from the village. Her parents and the other villagers searched far and wide in desperation, but there was no trace of her. As people were beginning to think she may have fallen prey to a monster, Leena returned home the next morning, as if nothing happened.<br />She claimed that she was summoned by the World Tree Yggdrasil, and was only interacting with it for half a day before coming home.<br />Naturally, she was shocked at the reaction of her parents and the villagers who claimed she was gone for much longer.<br /><br />After that incident, Leena would frequently visit the Yggdrasil, learning its magic and songs that soothe the human soul.<br />Leena herself claims she learned these from the Yggdrasil, but details on how it happened remain unclear.

	<h4>Speaking with Beasts</h4>
	<strong>Unlock at Lv30</strong>
	<br /><br />
	When Leena turned 15, something remarkable happened. An enormous beast appeared close to her village.<br />The villagers who witnessed this were quite rattled, and reported back to the village chief that they would soon be attacked. Fearing the village would be ravaged if nothing was done, the village chief called upon some guards stationed at Port Migal, asking them to dispatch a group of soldiers to suppress the nearby beast.<br />Leena caught word of this plan, and was the only one to speak out against it.<br /><br />"We're not entirely sure the beast will attack our village. It might be here for some other reason."<br /><br />But none of the villagers would listen, so she went alone to where the beast was spotted, and found it crouching low to the ground.<br />When the beast caught sight of Leena, it released a terrifying howl. But Leena sensed fear in its heart, and approached carefully so that it would not be stirred to anger.<br />Then she found large wounds on the monster's stomach and leg.<br /><br />"It's okay. I'll heal you now!"<br /><br />With that, Leena quickly applied the healing technique she learned from the Yggdrasil, curing the beast of its wounds. The beast finally understood that she meant no harm, and let its guard down.<br /><br />But soon after, the soldiers of Port Migal arrived with the villagers, surrounding the giant beast.<br />Villagers aware of Leena's solo trip in search of the beast immediately told the soldiers at Port Migal, who then quickly dispatched forces to suppress the beast. They told Leena to step away from it, since in their eyes it was about to attack her.<br />Of course, Leena knew this was a misunderstanding and tried to explain.<br /><br />"Please stop! He won't hurt us!"<br /><br />But the soldiers and villagers were so full of rage and fear with the beast in front of them, her words once again fell on deaf ears.<br />Suddenly surrounded by soldiers, the beast quickly prepared for battle. In the midst of this delicate situation, Leena was at a loss.<br />Then suddenly she remembered a song taught to her by the Yggdrasil, and with great determination, began to slowly and clearly sing with all her might.<br /><br />"As power sways,<br />the soul responds,<br />with life born in silence,<br />then given to the earth...<br />There is hope in darkness,<br />and hope in light,<br />yet granted all to one...<br />with only the healing power of respite remaining..."<br /><br />The song calmed the spirits of all who listened.<br />The soldiers were standing in front of the beast and ready to kill it, but as soon as they heard this song, their will to fight was mysteriously dulled, causing their rage and fear to melt away.<br />Even the beast understood Leena's intention was to avoid conflict. And after licking her hand as if to say thank you, it flew high into the sky to leave the area.<br /><br />Soon, the story of Leena's courage in preventing a fight between man and beast through song, had spread throughout the world, heard not only by humans but beasts as well.<br />Some of the beasts grew to admire Leena and went to visit her, as they were kind-hearted and not interested in confrontation. Although many were unable to speak, Leena was somehow able to communicate with them.<br />Eventually, those beasts established a small settlement near the Yggdrasil.

	<h4>Summons and Rage</h4>
	<strong>Unlock at Lv50</strong>
	<br /><br />
	Leena's fame grew rapidly, and she became known as 'Yggdrasil's Chosen Maiden, the Beast Whisperer'.<br />Word of her deeds even spread to the Holy Kingdom of Odal, where she was eventually summoned by order of the king. Unable to defy an order from the King of Odal, Leena traveled a great distance to the Odal Continent to visit His Majesty's royal castle.<br />There she demonstrated tree magic and healing techniques learned from the Yggdrasil, along with her own songs, before the king.<br />But before her final demonstration, when requested to perform the song that made her famous around the world for soothing the souls of man and beast, Leena suddenly changed her turn at the sight of what was brought before her.<br />An injured wolf beast, that had been imprisoned, was standing before her in a state of great agitation.<br /><br />"No matter how great your desire is to hear my song, I refuse to perform!"<br /><br />When seeing how the beast was being treated, Leena expressed great anger that was quite out of character for her, denouncing the king for his actions.<br />The king and his advisers thought of it as nothing more than a beast, and took Leena's words as a sign of great disrespect, rebuking her for them. But Leena refused to back down with her critical words, demanding that the beast be freed at once.<br />At this, the atmosphere grew more intense, with the king's advisors urging she be arrested for disrespecting His Majesty.<br />Soon after, the First Princess of Odal arrived just in time to resolve the situation.<br /><br />"Leena considers the beasts as her friends. And anyone would be angry to witness a friend treated as this."<br /><br />The First Princess caught wind of this situation from a trusted female knight. Her words calmed the king, and a promise was made to Leena that the beast would be freed.<br />Peace was made between them, and the First Princess's actions allowed Leena to leave the kingdom safely.

	<h4>Returning to the Earth</h4>
	<strong>Unlock at Lv80</strong>
	<br /><br />
	Leena left Odal and returned to her home on the Island of Migal, living a peaceful life for some years.<br />But eventually, the Great War between the God of Ruin and Humanity would break out. Although Leena refuse to directly participate in combat, she put forth great effort to protect human and beast alike.<br /><br />One day, Leena felt a terrible premonition, and for the first time in years, was led to meet with the Yggdrasil.<br />When she climbed the tree and saw what was brewing from afar, the premonition had finally made sense. A horde of Divine Beasts was gradually heading in her direction. They were minions of the God of the Ruin, plotting to destroy the World Tree Yggdrasil so that the Great Continent's power would be completely drained from the earth.<br /><br />"Don't worry... I'll take care of this!..."<br /><br />Sensing what the Army of Ruin had in store, Leena immediately focused her entire being on the situation. Her magic greatly enhanced the power of earth and plants possessed by the Yggdrasil, forming a protective barrier around them.<br />The army of Ruin closed in swiftly from air and sea to attack the Yggdrasil, but a tremendous power emanated from Leena's protective barrier. Most of the army's attacks were deflected back at them by the barrier, with a sacred power annihilating anyone who dared to approach recklessly.<br />For three months, the Army of Ruin attacked relentlessly, but Leena kept the barrier strong, rendering all of their attacks useless. Eventually, the God of Ruin was sealed away in defeat, and the Great War that had expanded worldwide had finally come to an end.<br />Forces in the Army of Ruin surrounding the Yggdrasil had retreated at last, and Leena's protective barrier was lifted sometime after that. But since that day, Leena was no longer with the Yggdrasil, and was never seen by another soul.<br /><br />The general consensus was that Leena's protective barrier was eventually breached by a few enemies, who then took her life. But her body was never found, a result which spawned many theories on her disappearance.<br />Some believe she expended so much power maintaining the protective barrier for so long, her body was completely consumed as a result. Others believe she focused so much of her magic on the Yggdrasil for so long, she became a part of it in the end.<br />There is really nothing concrete to base these theories on, and her disappearance remains a mystery to this very day.<br /><br />But there is no doubt that Leena, the kind-hearted maiden and local girl who saved the world, lives on forever in the hearts of the people of the Island of Migal, as her story will be passed down for generations.
