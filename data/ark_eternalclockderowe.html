	<h4>The Clock That Tells Fate</h4>
	<strong>Unlock at Lv2</strong>
	<br /><br />
	There exists an autonomous machine that tracks the hour for all eternity, known as the Eternal Clock De=Rowe.<br />Composed of a massive dial and surrounded by countless gears, few are aware of its existence, and far fewer have ever laid eyes upon it. Of those who claim to, almost none have seen its 'physical' form. That is because this clock — if an artifact so fantastic could be given a label so banal — only appears in the dreams of a particular sort of person.<br />Once it does, one thing is for certain: the dreamer will awaken to perform an engineering breakthrough.<br /><br />One such person invented entirely new skyship engine technology, while another created a massive weapon made wieldable through ingenious construction.<br />Curiously, while some of these inventors possessed knowledge in their field before their dream, others had hardly any education whatsoever.<br /><br />According to Dr. Garnan, an expert on paranormal activity:<br />“If De Lowe appeared only to those who possessed engineering expertise, then it would merely be an acknowledgment of one's skill.<br />But the fact that it appears on the verge of a breakthrough regardless of one's knowledge or training means that it operates on another dimension. De Lowe acknowledges not one's skill, but one's destiny.”<br /><br />— Excerpt from “Paranormal Granzelia”, Summer Edition

	Yep, sure did.<br />I saw that giant clock and its spinning gears in a dream once. A clock that bizarre ain't one you soon forget, dream or not.<br />You're tellin' me I'm not the only one? Well, I'll be.<br />In the dream I had, I was dead in front o' that clock before I realized it. It was a heck of a shock since I didn't notice I was dreamin' yet. I didn't move, didn't think, just stared at the contraption before me.<br />Suddenly, it let out a voice that I heard in my heart.<br /><br />“I shall show thee the way. Lay thy hands upon me and take a glimpse of thy fate.”<br /><br />It sounded fishy and more than a little creepy, but for some reason, I wasn't afraid of that voice. So I slowly reached out and did just as it said.<br />And then... I dunno, it was like memories flowed into my head. Those memories... or whatever they were, I could tell that I had seen and heard them with my own senses, except for the part where they'd never happened before.<br />So yeah, when I followed that clock's voice, it all came to me. Like, oh, I'm seein' stuff that's still to come. I'm seein' my future.<br />I tried to catch every second of it, but soon enough, I found myself wide awake in my room.<br />...Hm? Did that dream come in handy?<br />Well... 'handy' is a bit stronger than I'd put it, but it did give me confidence in myself as an inventor.<br /><br />— Excerpt from “One Man's Testimony” in “Paranormal Granzelia”, Summer Edition

	Is this about the dream?<br />Hmm... well, it sure didn't feel like a dream. No dream I've ever had let me move so naturally.<br />But one thing I could tell was that I was clearly a long way from home. I was so lost that I just stood there, stumped, until I heard a voice in my heart.<br /><br />“Come forth…"<br /><br />I dunno about you, but I get nervous when I get called all of a sudden. Especially when you don't know who's calling!<br />But hey, I didn't have anywhere else to go, so I did what it said. I followed the direction of the voice to find a gigantic floating machine!<br />I'd never seen anything like it, so I was mesmerized! And, well... just a little scared. I was half excited and half nervous, but I laid my hand on the machine and heard the voice in my heart again.<br /><br />“Repair this part…"<br /><br />I looked at the area the voice told me to, and saw that it seemed to be malfunctioning. I figured I could handle the repair job, but there was one problem: I didn't have my toolbox!<br />I was left scratching my head... and just then, I saw my trusty toolbox right by my feet. I wondered how that got here... but the whole experience was bizarre enough that I figured I should just roll with it.<br />I fixed the part I looked at, of course, but I woke up as soon as I shut the hood.<br />I normally forget dreams pretty soon after they end, but for some reason, I still remember that one as clear as day. Then again, if that really did happen in some other world, they could have at least said thanks before giving me the boot...<br /><br />— Excerpt from “One Girl's Testimony” in “Paranormal Granzelia”, Summer Edition

	<h4>The Clock's Gift</h4>
	<strong>Unlock at Lv10</strong>
	<br /><br />
	The first man we spoke to was a skyship maintenance technician, and as such already possessed a fair bit of engineering expertise prior to his dream.<br />After that dream, he revealed a revolutionary engine design to the world. It's thanks to his dream that modern skyships are so much safer now than they were a generation ago.<br /><br />The young lady who provided our second testimonial went on to create a massive mechanical hammer after her dream, a tool with which she would perform many acts of heroism.<br />But before her dream, she lacked any serious engineering knowledge — she was simply a child with a knack for tinkering. And as she herself admits, she found her dream a mere curiosity, a far cry from the divine revelation experienced by others.<br />And yet when she awoke, her mind welled with the blueprints for any device as fantastic as her imagination would allow. Did the clock residing in the 'dream world' grant her this power, or did the dream itself unlock a latent part of her mind she always possessed?<br />We're afraid we don't know the answer. What we do know is that after one dream, a young girl went from a playful child to an inventing prodigy.<br /><br />“What is De Lowe?”<br />We asked our expert on paranormal activity, Dr. Garnan, and he gave us this answer:<br /><br />“My hypothesis is that this clock possesses the power of a god, but for some particular reason cannot interfere directly with our world.<br />if nothing else, it's clear that our technological advancements are spurred on by otherworldly beings... if we can even call them our own. But to what end, I cannot say…"<br /><br />— Excerpt from “Paranormal Granzelia”, Summer Edition
