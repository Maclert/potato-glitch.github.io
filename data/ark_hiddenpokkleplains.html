	<h4>Cane of Elders</h4>
	<strong>Unlock at Lv2</strong>
	<br /><br />
	In the depths of a forest found on the continent of Aldana, there was a village where the Pokkle live in harmony with one another.<br />Though the Elder Pokkle of the village was responsible for enforcing a code of rules, for the most part the villagers lived freely as they saw fit.<br /><br />Within the village there lived a group of three Pokkle children, Tera, Po and Lara, who were fast friends. One day however, the group became embroiled in a minor quarrel. The cause of the quarrel was the cane which the Elder Pokkle always kept in hand. <br /><br />The controversy started with Tera.<br />“The Elder says that his staff is actually the legendary Yggdrasil Rod. There’s no way that the Elder would lie about something like that!”<br /><br />The Elder Pokkle often boasted that he had once climbed the World Tree Yggdrasil and received a legendary rod, known as the Yggdrasil Rod, from the spirit which dwelt there. Po, however, was not convinced.<br />“Hmph! There’s no way that a legendary rod like that could have found its way here to our tiny village. I bet that show-off of an Elder is lying through his crooked, yellow teeth!”<br /><br />Lara, now finding herself in the middle of two stubborn friends refusing to give na inch to the other, made a proposal.<br />“How about we go and check it out for ourselves?”<br /><br />“What do you even mean by ‘check it out?’ What are you suggesting we do? Are we supposed to just waltz up to the Elder and ask, ‘Hey, is that staff actually real?’ Of course he’ll say it is!”<br /><br />After pondering Po’s words for a moment, Lara came back with a new proposal.<br />“Well, how about we sneak into the Elder’s house while the rod is unguarded and check for ourselves?”<br /><br />Tera and Po were surprised by Lara’s unexpected proposal.<br /><br />“Woah! W-wait a minute. We can’t do that!”<br /><br />“If we actually tried that… and were discovered, we’d be in a whole heap of trouble!”<br /><br />Despite the opposition of her two friends, Lara did not relent.<br />“Party poopers! If there’s any other way to check, I’m all ears!”<br /><br />“There’s no other way…”<br /><br />“Well then, it’s decided!”<br /><br />With that settled, Lara led the other two Pokkle children as fast as she could to the Elder’s house. Lara herself had in fact a keen interest in the Elder’s staff.<br /><br />– Excerpt from the fairy tale, “The Pokkles and the Rod”

	Terra and her two friends made their way to the Elder’s house. When they arrived, the Elder’s house appeared to be empty. Yet, peering through the front window they saw it: sitting on a large table was the rod they had come for. The three Pokkle children made their way inside. <br />(It is important to note here that Pokkle houses do not have proper doors and Pokkle villagers leave their houses open and unlocked at all times.)<br />Po, who was the first of the three to enter the house, quickly took the rod that had been placed on the table.<br /><br />“So this is the Elder’s rod. It does look kinda old, but I don’t see anything special about it!”<br />As he spoke, Po waved the rod around in the air.<br />“Look, see? It doesn’t have any special power.”<br /><br />Tera nervously attempted to grab the rod from Po.<br />“Cut it out! What if it really does have some special power and you set it off?”<br /><br />“It’s fine. This is just a regular stick after all.”<br /><br />Po continued to brandish and wave the rod about despite Tera’s protests. Lara started to grow impatient.<br /><br />“Hey, I wanna see it too.”<br /><br />Lara, Po and Tera jostled about as they each tried to take or keep possession of the rod. Just then…<br /><br />“Ah!!”<br /><br />Po lost his grip on the rod, which then went flying before hitting the nearby wall with a crack. When the rod hit the ground it had already broken straight down the middle. Tera picked up the broken rod nervously.<br /><br />“Wh-what are we gonna do now…?”<br /><br />The color drained from Po and Lara’s faces.<br /><br />“What do you mean what are we gonna do…?”<br /><br />“Th-there’s gotta be a way we can stick it back together… right?”<br /><br />Just as the three Pokkle children started to panic, they heard a voice coming from the entrance of the house.<br /><br />“Just what do you think you’re doing in MY house?”<br /><br />The village Elder had returned.<br /><br />– Excerpt from the fairy tale, “The Pokkles and the Rod”

	“Just what do you thin you’re doing in MY house?”<br />Having just returned, the Elder looked at Po, Lara and Tera with a flummoxed expression.<br />His gaze quickly shifted to the broken rod rolling around on the floor where the children stood.<br />“I see. So you were interested in my rod? Is that why you have come into my home?”<br />“Sorry, Elder! It’s just that… the staff…”<br />Tera nervously handed it over to the Elder.<br /><br />“Hmmm, looks like it’s broken. Not much to be done about that, I suppose.”<br /><br />“A-Aren’t you mad?”<br />Tera, who had been bracing herself for the mother of all tongue-lashings, was taken aback by the Elder’s calm demeanor.<br />The Elder simply laughed.<br /><br />“Hohoho, I can appreciate your youthful curiosity!”<br />Upon hearing the Elder’s reply and realizing that he was not angry, the three children let out a collective sigh of relief. Po, however, could not contain his curiosity.<br /><br />“So if you’re not mad, does that mean that this rod isn’t really the Yggdrasil Rod?”<br />The Elder pondered Po’s question momentarily before replying.<br />“Hmmm… I suppose you’re right about that. The broken rod that you see before you is not the Yggdrasil Rod. It’s actually a replica that was made to look like the real deal.”<br />When Tera heard the Elder’s words, she felt sad and wanted to cry.<br />“How could our trusted Elder have lied to us?” she lamented to herself quietly. Po and Lara, on the other hand, were more direct.<br /><br />“I knew it…”<br />The Elder, after seeing the three children’s collective reaction, spoke to them suddenly as though he had just realized something important.<br /><br />“Hmmm… Maybe you three should follow me. There’s something very special that I’d like to show you.”<br /><br />– Excerpted from the fairy tale “The Pokkles and the Rod”

	The Elder brought the three Pokkle children, Tera, Po and Lara before a small shrine in the center of the village. Lara looked at the shrine with keen eyes.<br /><br />“Is this what you meant be ‘something very special?’ We play around here all the time…”<br />The Elder responded as though he knew what Lara was about to ask.<br /><br />“Have you ever seen the inside?”<br /><br />“Huh, the inside? Isn’t it against the rules to look inside…?”<br /><br />“Indeed, it is usually against the rules, but today is a special exception.”<br />The Elder opened the shrine door and showed the inside to the three children. There the children saw a wooden rod stuck in the ground. The rod gave off a bright, dazzling light. The three children were duly surprised.<br /><br />“What the… What is this?”<br /><br />“This is the real Yggdrasil Rod.”<br /><br />“No way!!”<br /><br />The Elder continued as if recalling a precious memory nearly long since forgotten.<br />“When I was younger, I made a journey to the base of the World Tree Yggdrasil and was given one of its branches. I will never forget what the spirit of the tree said to me. ‘When your friends are in danger, stick this branch into the ground.’<br />I made the branch into a rod and kept it safe for a long time, until one year the sun scorched our crop and our whole village was gripped by famine. I knew then that I recalled the words of the spirit. I knew that the time had come to use the rod to help my fellow villagers, so I stuck it into the ground. When I did so, vitality was restored to our fields and our crops once again began to grow. From then on, I kept the rod in the ground and built a shrine around it so that little troublemakers like you three wouldn’t get your mitts on it, then I forbade everyone from looking inside.”<br /><br />The three troublemakers stood in stunned silence at the Elder’s story. The Elder laughed mirthfully at the sight.<br /><br />“It was vanity that caused me to fashion a fake rod and carry it around with me. I wouldn’t really look the part of village elder if I just walked around empty handed after all. Heheh…”<br />Grinning slightly impishly, the Elder then added:<br />“Even though it’s a fake, I must admit that I have grown a little attached to it after carrying it around for all these years. I know I said I wasn’t angry, but I’m still going to have to punish you a little bit for breaking it.”<br />The three children eyed each other nervously: they had thought they had already escaped punishment. <br /><br />“What…!?”<br />“That’s…”<br />“I’m sorry…”<br /><br />Shortly thereafter the Elder assigned them their punishment: they were to search the forest for the finest branch they could find to serve as a replacement for the Elder’s broken rod.<br /><br />– Excerpted from the fairy tale “The Pokkles and the Rod”<br /><br />The fairy tale “The Pokkles and the Elder’s Rod” was originally recorded by the fairy tale author and Pokkle researcher Dion. Dion penned many works featuring Pokkles as main characters, and his tales were beloved by children of all ages. However, Dion’s style of romanticizing the Pokkle as too “human-like” has been criticized by other Pokkle researchers and the author himself has on occasion acknowledged as much.<br />However, not all of Dion’s writings are pure fiction. For example, in “The Pokkles and the Elder’s Rod”, a rod made from a branch of Yggdrasil is supposedly stuck in the ground in the middle of a Pokkle village, and in fact some Pokkles have been known to bury various branches and seedlings in the ground where they live as a way of bringing life to the soil. Dion’s works represent an enchanting mix of imagination and truth.
