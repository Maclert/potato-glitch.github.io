	<h4>Meeting Santa Claus</h4>
	<strong>Unlock at Lv10</strong>
	<br /><br />
	In Granzelia, the festival known as 'Christmas' originated from the story of the great undertaking of Saint 'Santa Claus.' It had become a festival celebrated by both man and Beast. On this day, street and houses would be filled with decoration, and people would enjoy the day with their family, friends, or loved ones.<br /><br />It was one day near Christmas, where a snowstorm forced Theria and her party to take shelter in a cabin in the woods. Upon going through the door, they were in awe. The entire house was occupied by gift boxes and wrapping paper in every corner. But the most surprising object was what Theria found.<br /><br />"Could this be-!?"<br /><br />What came to her sight, was the costume of Santa Claus. The followers of the original Saint Santa have carried out his name, and remained active to this day. The elderly owner of the home happened to be one of these followers. To the surprise of Kyle and the others, Theria got excited with her findings, as she had always loved the stories of Santa all throughout her childhood. She asked the old man many questions, all which he happily replied, with the exception of his plans for this upcoming Christmas.<br />He then explained to the party, that he recently started having excruciating back pains, making it very difficult for him to walk.<br /><br />"I'd love to give gifts this year, but I feel like I can't get around to all of the children this year..."<br /><br />Hearing his words, Theria paused for a brief moment, and decided to offer her help.<br /><br />"Would it be alright, if I help as a substitute Santa and bring presents to the children this Christmas?"

	<h4>Memories of the Holy Night</h4>

	For Theria, Christmas is not only a holiday, but a special day with memories she holds dear.<br /><br />Back in her days at Samel Village, Theria used to live with her brother. However, she spent most of her time alone as her brother often went on expeditions to investigate ruins. Naturally, Christmas was no exception. The other members of the village would invite Theria to join their parties, to which she would politely decline. Theria didn't want to distract them from their own family, and more importantly, she wanted to stay home in case her brother came back.<br /><br />(He'd be so upset if he came home and it was empty, especially Christmas...)<br /><br />Years passed by, and on one Christmas... Theria prepared Christmas dishes and waited for her brother, just as she always did. But as night arrived, she came to the realization that she would be alone. Again. Despite the fact she had experienced it numerous times, Theria couldn't help but feel sad. And that was when a loud knock came to the doors.<br />With no clue to who it'd be, Theria slowly opened the door and was greeted by none other than Santa Claus.<br /><br />"I've come to give the children on the nice list a special gift!"<br /><br />Santa said, cheerfully, and handed Theria a present box. Astonished and speechless, she held the present in her hands. Looking up, she realized she knew the identity of this Santa.<br /><br />"Hehe, welcome home!♪"<br /><br />That was the first Christmas in years that Theria got to spend with someone. The present her brother gave to her was a teddy bear that held a sword in its paws. One that her brother promised would protect her.<br />From that year on, no matter how busy he was, Theria's brother would always return home for Christmas, the yearly tradition stopping only when he went missing.<br /><br />It was the one day that she knew he would return home.

	"Would it be alright, if I help as a substitute Santa and bring presents to the children for this Christmas?"<br /><br />Theria suggested to the elderly Santa Claus. Although surprised by this sudden offer, the elderly Santa soon understood that this young lady was eager for the responsibility. After mulling it over while Theria's eyes begged, he eventually gave in and agreed to let her become a replacement Santa.<br /><br />Kyle and the others were astounded that hear their usually timid Theria speak up so excitedly. Feeling that Theria must have strong emotions towards Christmas, the party all decided to lend a hand as well. However, the elderly Santa stated that there was indeed, one problem for Theria to become a Santa Claus.<br /><br />According to tradition, Santa Claus must go deep into the woods and get help from the deer to pull the sleigh. However, the deer in the area were wary towards outsiders, meaning that Theria would need to get approval from the elder of the deers. A descendant of the first Santa's deer Beasts.<br /><br />Theria and the party soon departed for the woods, where they were surrounded by sharp glances. A voice came from the depeest of the shadows, but it was as if the voice was directly in their heads.<br /><br />"Who are you? What is it that you want?"<br /><br />As the voice reached them, a monstrous deer came forward. Much larger than any animal they'd previously seen, to the point that anyone would agree that it should be seen as a Beast. Kyle and the others had their hands on their weapons, ready for combat. The intimidating aura pressuring them into fight or flight.<br />But Theria put her staff at her feet and looked up to the looming, beastly deer. Without a hint of fear or hesitation, she told the elder deer their story.<br />How the elderly Santa had terrible backaches, and the possibility of not being able to deliver the Christmas presents. She went on to tell the elder deer about how the Santa approved of her, and that she was there for approval from the deer.<br /><br />The elder deer listened to Theria in silence, and finally gave his reply.<br />"Leave here. You will not have our help."<br />However, Theria didn't leave.<br /><br />"I've...experienced this holiday alone, so many times. I know this sadness, and that's exactly why I can't let it happen to anyone else. Christmas should be a time where nobody is left unhappy. I can't do it on my own! I still need the help of my friends, but most of all, I'll need help from you!"<br /><br />Now, Theria isn't eloquent or skillful with words, but her passion for the holiday was still there.<br />Her pure, honest emotions reached not only the elder, not only the deer, but her friends as well. No one, especially those that held their memories of Christmas dear to their hearts, could resist her words...<br />For a while, the giant deer stayed silent, moved by her words. Finally the elder spoke.<br /><br />"It seems that it was true that Santa Claus approved of you... Very well then, I shall approve your wish as well. According to tradition, you shall have help from our kind."<br /><br />Before they realized, Theria and the party was surrounded by all the deer that lurked in the shadows. The giant deer who stood before them had already vanished. Despite the trouble, Theria had successfully gained the help of all the deer, and is now ready for the final trial. To deliver presents on Christmas.

	<h4>A Present for My Brother</h4>
	<strong>Unlock at Lv80</strong>
	<br /><br />
	As Christmas came closer, Theria and the other makeshift Santa Clauses all clambered onto the sleigh to deliver present to children within the region. They had a few accidents and stories on the big day itself. Making it snow in a certain desert city, or helping stranded villagers with their sleigh. However, in the end, everything went smoothly. The party gave the presents to every child, and had a newfound appreciation for the holiday as they were the ones that brought happiness.<br /><br />Finishing their job, the party went back to rest at the elderly Santas house. However, still caught in the magical excitement of being a Santa Claus, Theria went outside to watch the powdered snow slowly fall. After seeing all of the smiles from children on that day, Theria felt a sense of accomplishment, but at the same time, another thought came to mind.<br /><br />"My brother..."<br /><br />As she whispered to herself, Theria took out a small box from her pocket. A gift that she prepared for her brother years ago. One that never made it to him.<br /><br />(Where are you? Are you enjoying this day with someone you care about?)<br /><br />As Theria let her mind wander. And wander it did, as a terrifying thought crossed her mind.<br /><br />(Did you return to the empty home? Will you...ever return? Are you...still alive...?)<br /><br />The horrifying imagination was about to trap her mind and tore her apart, when suddenly she heard a voice calling her.<br /><br />"What's with that present? Need help opening it or did we miss a delivery?"<br /><br />Theria looked up, seeing Kyle standing close. Quickly hiding her sorrow, Theria explained that this was a gift for her brother. A gift she couldn't give because he went missing.<br />An awkward tension rising, Kyle could only muster out a, “…Huh ...I see."<br />But then a rare idea crossed his mind.<br /><br />"Alright! Cool! That means you should hold on to it, because next Christmas, I'm sure you'll get it to him! You can be Santa again!"<br /><br />Kyle's simple words cut through her murky thoughts.<br /><br />(He's right...! I need to have faith in my brother! I know my brother and Kyle very well, and I know I can trust them both!)<br /><br />With her spirits restored and renewed, Theria answered Kyle's words with a confident nod and a peppy 'Okay!'<br />Waiting for that reunion in the far off future, Theria put the present box into her pocket, where it will continue to rest.
