	<h4>Parade</h4>
	<strong>Unlock at Lv2</strong>
	<br /><br />
	There is a certain photograph in storage at the Aldana Imperial Museum. It features a woman riding an enormous animal with a whole town of people cheering her on.<br />That woman's name was Lilah.<br />She was the first princess of the Holy Odal Kingdom who advocated starting the war against the God oF Ruin, and contributed greatly to mankind's victory. However, she tragically lost her life during the war.<br /><br />This photograph was taken during a parade that took place long before the war, when she was returning to the castle after defeating some Beasts.<br />Lilah was one of the few in the Odal royal family who actively worked for the sake of the people. She was a master archer and led her royal guards into battle all around the Odal continent to defeat Beasts that were causing people distress.<br />And each time she would return from one of her campaigns, the citizens of her kingdom would shower her with passionate admiration and hold parades like the one in the photograph.<br />The people loved Lilah dearly, and there was not a single person on the Odal continent who did not know her name, even if they did not know the actual name of their king.<br /><br />It was believed that at first, the King of Odal did not approve of Lilah's going out to eliminate Beasts of her own accord. However, after Lilah defeated several Beasts and became tremendously popular with the common people, he changed his stance and endorsed it instead.<br />What had started as a parade held among the common people soon became a grand event sponsored by the kingdom.<br /><br />By the way, the enormous animal she's riding is a puryao. They were a rare species found on the Odal continent and bred in the kingdom.<br />These animals were used during parades for increasing morale, and for photographs. When Aldana took over Odal, these animals were already gone from the castle. It is currently unknown whether they had already been extinct at the time, or if someone had released them all into the wild.

	<h4>History of the Guard</h4>
	<strong>Unlock at Lv4</strong>
	<br /><br />
	In the photograph of the parade, there is a procession of Princess Lilah’s royal guards behind her.<br />As the word suggests, they were a team of guards who protected Lilah.<br /><br />The woman who proposed the formation of this team was Saliah, who served as their commanding officer. You can see her in the photograph, riding on a puryao just behind Lilah.<br />Saliah was related to the royal family and was Lilah’s playmate when they were young. Once they grew up, Saliah served at Lilah’s side as her protective knight.<br /><br />When Lilah set her mind to fighting off the Beasts for the sake of the people, Saliah tried desperately to stop her, but she soon realized that it was futile.<br />Lilah would not be swayed.<br />Therefore, Saliah proposed a compromise: she would put together a team to protect her.<br />In other words, she would organize a team of royal guards for the princess.<br /><br />Lilah gave her consenta nd Saliah immediately set about picking the members of the team.<br />To be the princess’ royal guard, it was a general rule that one had to be of good social standing, but skills as a soldier were important as well. Saliah picked soldiers who could protect Lilah in a real fight, so that the guards were not just for show.<br />The members weren’t the cream of the crop, but they all had sufficient fighting skills, or the makings of great fighters. Once assembled, Saliah and the other royal guards accompanied Lilah even through the great war with the God of Ruin.<br />They survived many battles together.<br /><br />Lilah and Saliah may have been princess and servant, but as they had known each other since they were young, Saliah would frequently admonish Lilah harshly. The princess could be ignorant at times about the ways of the world, so Saliah actually did this out of her concern for Lilah.<br />Lilah had complete trust in Saliah her whole life too, and valued her opinion. However, many saw such speech and conduct as Saliah overstepping her rank and would advise Lilah to make Saliah fix her behavior, and to keep to the bounds of their relationship.<br />Lilah would respond as follows to these kinds of opinions:<br /><br />“I don’t mind what she says. You see, Saliah is like a big sister to me.”

	<h4>Monster Dispatch</h4>
	<strong>Unlock at Lv7</strong>
	<br /><br />
	Before the great war with the God of Ruin, Lilah and her royal guards defeated many Beasts across the Odal continent. Among those, the one she had most famously slain was a gigantic winged Beast from the Moriana Plateau.<br /><br />Lilah and company immediately headed to the Moriana Plateau after hearing of a giant monster from farmers who lived near the area. Although it hadn’t killed anyone yet, they decided to slay it after hearing that there were several farmers who were injured by its attacks, and that it was eating the crops.<br /><br />According to a villager, it was a great Beast with wings, so Saliah guessed that it would have a nest in the mountain range bordering the plateau. She proposed that they first locate its nest.<br />Lilah agreed, and so they lay in wait for the winged creature to make an appearance. They decided that they would stay their hand that time and merely observe it.<br /><br />The Beast appeared before long, and after it gobbled up the village’s crops, Lilah and her guards watched it fly off toward the northern mountain range. They followed its traces and soon found the whereabouts of its nest.<br /><br />Saliah split the team into two groups and came up with a plan. One group was to intercept and attack the Beast when it appeared near the village. The other group would wait at the nest for it to return, and then deliver the final blow.<br />But which group would Lilah be in? It was almost a certainty that the group that attacked the Beast head-on would be embroiled in a fierce battle. However, the group waiting at the nest to deliver the final blow wasn’t guaranteed to be safe from harm either. Since it would be wounded, it might muster the last of its strength before it died, to swoop down and raze the team.<br />Saliah could not make up her mind.<br />Sensing her knight’s indecision, Lilah readily declared that she would be in the group that first attacked the Beast.<br />Saliah was left dumbfounded, so Lilah told her, “There is equal danger for both groups. It’s a waste of energy to be indecisive about it.”<br />And so, they put their plan into action against the great winged Beast.<br /><br />When it appeared to raid the village, Lilah’s team launched their attack all at once. The Beast was powerful, and the royal guards fought hard against its claws and fangs. However, Lilah was unperturbed by the Beast’s ferocity. She kept a level head as she fired precise arrows at the vital parts of its body.<br /><br />With her fifth shot, the Beast finally began to flee to the sky, letting out a mighty shriek as it went. Weakened, it headed back to its nest.<br />Saliah was waiting at its nest and spotted it coming back. As her team prepared to launch their attack, the Beast merely dropped from the sky into its nest and stopped moving.<br />It turned out that Lilah had already fatally injured it with her arrows. While the Beast had managed to make it back to its nest, the effort of doing so had drained it of all of its strength.<br /><br />When Saliah confirmed the Beast’s death, she was amazed at her princess’ skill with the bow, but also very proud of her.

	<h4>After the Festival</h4>
	<strong>Unlock at Lv10</strong>
	<br /><br />
	Princess Lilah lost her life during one of the battles in Aldana. She was visiting there during the great war against the God of Ruin. After she died, they could not even find her remains.<br /><br />The news of her death brought great sorrow to the people of Odal. For a time, the entire country seemed as if it had lost its spirit.<br />Her royal guards remained in Aldana for a time to search for her remains, but they eventually returned home empty-handed. Her guards were disbanded and Saliah was questioned by the king for her inability to protect the princess. While Saliah was not executed because of her relation to the royal family, she was stripped of her knighthood and punished for her conduct.<br />She didn’t try to protest her sentence, but it is said that she herself desired the death penalty.<br /><br />After the great war, the Holy Odal Kingdom attempted to cruelly exploit Aldana, but Saliah appealed to the king, saying that Princess Lilah would have never wished for that.<br />However, this only served to incite the king’s rage. He banished her into exile. It is unknown what happened to her after, but one theory says that she crossed to the continent of Aldana, secretly living in isolation with their support.<br /><br />After the disbandment of their team, most of the royal guards were assigned to different squads in the Holy Odal Kingdom’s army. However, they came under severe criticism by the public for their failure to protect the princess.<br /><br />Later, one of the former guards commented on the matter during an interview with a historian. He said the following about life during that time:<br /><br />“That’s right, no matter what squad we were assigned to, we were still blamed for not being able to protect the princess.<br />I can’t say I blame them though. She was beloved by all and no one could fill the void left by her loss. I blamed myself for a long time. In a time of weakness, I even regretted becoming one of her royal guards. I think all of us who formerly served her were probably in the same state of mind at the time.<br />But now that I’m older, when I think back on my younger years, the first thing that comes to mind is my time serving as Princess Lilah’s royal guard.<br />How could I not?<br />All of us were entirely devoted to her and felt an inexpressible sense of fulfilment in our duty. Princess Lilah just had that special kind of charisma that made others feel that way. Even now, I regret not being able to save her, but I still feel proud to have served as her guard.<br />I think I have Princess Lilah to thank for being able to feel that way even after all these years.”
