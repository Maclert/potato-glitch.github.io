	<h4>Bells that Cry Change</h4>
	<strong>Unlock at Lv2</strong>
	<br /><br />
	“When change rocks the land, the Bell Tower shall show itself. The fortunate ones who see it will learn whether the world is to meet with blessings or banes.”<br /><br />These prophetic words are relayed as part of the oral tradition of Granzelia. The Bell Tower is said to be a monumental mechanical tower that manifests when the world is about to undergo a major change. Noting is known about its true nature and few have ever seen it, but it has existed since around the time the God of Ruin first began to rule over Granzelia. According to contemporary accounts, the Bell Tower appears without so much as a warning, and after making its incredible form known, it rings out a high-pitched chime and then vanishes like the mist.<br /><br />It seems that only certain individuals are able to view the Bell Tower, and in some cases even people standing immediately to their side will not be able to view it. Indeed, it is seen by some and hidden to all the rest.<br /><br />There are at least as many different ways to describe the tone as there are people who have heard it; and while some say that it is clangorous, others insist that it is the resonant and harmonic sound of good fortune itself. As the words of tradition state, the timbre of the bell is a sign of the tenor of the age to come.<br /><br />A certain researcher into inter-dimensional phenomena has suggested the bell tower doesn’t exist in Granzelia but rather in another dimension. But if that is the case, why has it shown itself in Granzelia? And why is it only ever visible to a limited few people? Perhaps these questions can be answered through additional research.

	Several months have passed since the occupation of the Arden Border. The lands below is filled with so many soldiers from the Holy Kingdom Odal that not even a mouse could slip through. But the morale of the soldiers here on the border remain high.<br /><br />Having long suffered under the exploitation of Odal, the soldiers are eager to liberate Aldana. Following the great war against Lougseus, life has only grown harsher. And since its loss in the Great War, Odal is surely desperate to restore its national power. The First Princess, who had long served as a symbol of the kingdom, supposedly laid down her life in that conflict. Even so, that’s no excuse for us Aldanians to be at the mercy of even harsher tyrants. The war has proved exhausting for everyone involved…<br /><br />Given the high morale of the soldiers, they’ll likely be guarding the border for a long while to come. Of course, though we can’t sally out, we can continue to defend. If we fight here at the Arden Border, we’ll doubtlessly be able to recruit same-minded soldiers elsewhere.<br /><br />That said, we’ll hardly be immune from danger. It could be that Odal’s long-standing system of governance could have won over the hearts and minds of the Aldanians to a greater extent than we’ve realized. They may simply look on us with cold indifference.<br /><br />No, we cannot indulge such doubts at this late stage. Somewhere out there are others who feel the same as we do… We must keep the faith.<br /><br />It’s generally in the depths of night that the unsettling thoughts arise. Recently, I left my quarters and climbed up on the rock that marks the border. Right before daybreak the chill air seemed as if it might freeze me whole, but it was pleasant in its own way. I looked in the direction where the sun would rise, and prepared to begin a new day with the Aldanian soldiers who watch over this border.<br /><br />However, in my line of sight there was no sun, but rather something entirely different. While I absentmindedly stared at it, the bell gradually began to move, and at last it rang out with a sonorous tone that made me feel as if I were in a dream. But before I realized, that great tower had vanished entirely. What was it? Had I dozed off?<br /><br />At that moment, a strange conviction arose in my heart. I knew that victory in battle would be ours.<hr />Around the time of the Aldanian War of Independence, the passage above was inscribed by one Commander Radicale, who was holed up on the Arden Border after a monumental battle with the great army of the Holy Kingdom Odal.<br /><br />The colossal bell tower that he mentions therein is believed to be the Bell Tower of legend. And the day on which it appeared – which is to say, the day on which that note was written – was when Soleil, son of the hero Adel, was recruited for the cause of Aldanian independence. And it’s common knowledge that the long series of changes that would create the Aldanian Empire began on that day.

	<h4>Sound of Despair</h4>

	Just as I would any other morning, I had gone to the cathedral to offer a prayer to the Creator of All.<br /><br />“O Lord, who makes all creatures great and small, I offer thee my gratitude for the new morning which thou hast given me.”<br /><br />While I quietly spoke these words from the liturgy, the strangest phenomenon occurred. As if out of nowhere, I began to feel a peculiar shock, much as if space itself had slammed against my body. If forced to describe it in conventional terms, I would say it was a sort of heavy pressure. Taken aback, I stopped praying and looked around, but there seemed to be no damage or other disturbance to the cathedral. Additionally, my elder sister, who was standing right beside me, continued praying as if nothing had occurred.<br /><br />Overwhelmed by confusion, I soon ran outside, for something gave me the notion that the weighty sensation was coming from outside the cathedral. Once out-of-doors, I saw a gigantic bell tower that almost seemed to be fluttering in midair.<br /><br />Wh-what could this be?!<br /><br />The incomprehensible spectacle left me dumbfounded and dumbstruck. One moment, I thought that I saw the bell subtly moving, and in the next moment, it was ringing out loud and clear. The uncanny clattering seemed to eat at my heart and mind, and in spite of myself, I fell down on my hands and my knees. Unable to bear the offensive sound of the bells any longer, I simply lost consciousness.<br /><br />It was several hours later that I awakened. The deeply unpleasant sensation that had overtaken me seemed as if it had been a dream, and the tower that had been floating in the air had vanished without a trace. My sister was greatly concerned when I ran from the cathedral and lost consciousness, but I couldn’t bring myself to explain my experience. It somehow seemed that even if I were to share it, I wouldn’t be believed, and besides – that sight wasn’t meant for others.<br /><br />The strangest part of this for me was that, when I first saw that colossal tower in the sky, it should have been visible to the others around me, but they didn’t talk about it at all.<br /><br />Had it been a mere illusion? Or was it an omen of misfortune to come?<hr />The above note dates from shortly before the beginning of Lougseus’s rule over Granzelia. Shortly after the devotee of Lagduell, Creator of All, penned it, she and all others were banned from practicing their religion. But because she refused to abandon her creed, she was sentenced to crucifixion and incineration. The ilk of Lougseus frequently punished followers of the rival god by means of these so-called Apostate’s Roasts – through this they intended to show that cries for help would not be answered by the God of Creation. But the author of this passage refused to renounce her faith, and she never asked for divine help. In contemporary times, she is commemorated as one of the most holy figures of the Church of the Creator at the Great Temple Maja.

	<h4>Time of Change</h4>

	“Why does the bell tower show itself in times of change?”<br /><br />In recent years, a theory about that very mystery has emerged, but not from researchers into the Otherworld; rather, it originates with the historian Dukdal.<br /><br />“In times of great upheaval or turmoil, the emotional state of the people is – for better or for worse – greatly agitated, and they cannot help but become active. Wide-scale movements and intellectual vitality result from this, and eventually run their course. So perhaps the bell tower does not, as long assumed, presage a time of coming change but rather shows itself in response to such fluctuations of sentiment.”<br /><br />The veracity of this theory cannot be determined within the current limits of Granzelian technology, which cannot so much as locate the bell tower in the first place. However, this theory of Dukdal has gathered a certain amount of support among researchers into the Otherworld.<br /><br />At present, the Imperial Society is reassessing the Bell Tower in the course of research, for the reason that a great number of reports of the tower have recently been submitted. Could this be a sign that something monumental will happen in Granzelia in the days to come?
