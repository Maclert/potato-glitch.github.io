	<h4>The Three Cave Brothers</h4>
	<strong>Unlock at Lv2</strong>
	<br /><br />
	During the God of Ruin’s tyrannical reign, there were three Gobl brothers living in the Malborian Caves on the continent of Aldana.<br />Gobls are known for their high fertility rates, meaning they’re quite common. Because of this, there has to be a special reason that these three in particular, are still remembered to this day.<br /><br />They were considered brave warriors even among the Gobls, as they had protected their territory in the caves so well that they even repelled attempted invasions by the God of Ruin’s followers and humans alike.<br />The three brothers cooperate din battle, working off one another’s strong points. This allowed them to fortify their defenses until nothing could disrupt their brotherly bond.<br />The eldest brother, Don, had a keen eye and a calm, analyzing mind in battle, making him an effective leader.<br />The middle brother, Leo, had both the quickest feet and the quickest wits, allowing him to swiftly move to the best tactical positions on the fly.<br />And the third brother, Mody, was a hard worker, faithfully carrying out his instructions and facing his opponents with dauntless courage.<br /><br />Gradually, these brothers made a name for themselves among those who dared approach the caves: the Dolmod Brothers. It was a moniker which combined the names of each individual brother.<br />Furthermore, the brothers were apparently friendly to non-aggressive visitors who showed no intention of invading. For example, several records remain of the brothers trading the mountain’s natural resources with humans.<br />Some rumors said they would help guide inhabitants from the nearby harbor town, who had gone astray in the mountains, and bring them safely back home.<br />Clearly, these brothers possessed the wit and wisdom to choose the best way to interact with others depending on each individual situation.

	<h4>The Brothers' Tactics</h4>

	While individual Gols may deviate form the norm, Gobls in general are anything but strong. But the Dolmod brothers compensated for their physical limitations with their intelligence, and they repelled invaders from their caves time and time again.<br /><br />Their preferred method of fighting involved several steps.<br />First, they would lure away the enemy with Leo acting as a decoy.<br />Next, after Leo had led their opponents to a predetermined area, Don and Mody would flank the enemy for a pincer attack.<br />Matching his brothers’ timing, Leo would turn around and launch a counterattack.<br />This three-sided surprise attack had apparently saved the brothers from danger countless times. Also, as they were able to move around relatively freely in the dark, they had a natural advantage in the caves.<br /><br />The Dolmod Brothers were famously mischievous, and often competed among themselves to see who could loot the most of their targets’ possessions, be it money or food.<br />It is said that each brother was quite successful in his pilfering due to their individual strengths: Leo was fast on his feet, Don was crafty with traps to bring in the big hauls, and Mody was a heavy lifter.<br />They were able to keep up this game of theirs because of the continuous arrival of enemies and trespassers.<br />But the more invasions they had to defend against, the more exhausted they became, and it was soon clear that there was a limit to their strength and wisdom.<br /><br />It was then that a certain human offered them his help. He had once been in dire straits near the caves, but the Dolmod Brothers had saved him and safely escorted him to the harbor town at the base of the mountains.

	The man who offered to help the Dolmod Brothers was from Aldana. While sailing from the capital city to the harbor town, he had gotten shipwrecked. From there, he walked to the caves.<br />Upon entering the caves he lost consciousness, and the three brothers approached him in an attempt to steal his belongings. However, right before they could rob him, the man awoke.<br />They all stared at one another, face-to-face.<br /><br />The man looked at them with neither fear nor hatred, but instead as fellow living beings. He handed them the food he had been carrying of his own volition. Then he requested that the brothers allow him to rest in the cave’s entrance until he regained his stamina.<br />The brothers agreed to his request in exchange for the food.<br /><br />True to his word, the man only stayed by the entrance and did not invade the brothers’ territory beyond it. The man’s actions, different from those of any other human they had encountered, initially perplexed the brothers.<br />But gradually, they opened their hearts to him, as he had treated them with respect. Eventually, when the man had recovered and was able to descend the mountains, the brothers helped him find his way.<br />He never forgot their kindness, and thus showed himself again in the brothers’ time of need, when they had grown tired of driving out invaders.<br /><br />So many had sought to invade these caves because they had heard rumors of precious ore veins buried within. To assist his prior benefactors, the man began to investigate.<br />The brothers were touched that he was mining the caves for their sake, and took up tools of their own to join in. They soon found that there were no such lodes in the caves to begin with. However, it was highly unlikely that those looking for treasure would believe them.<br /><br />Thereafter, instead of using the usual pincer attack strategy, the man and the Dolmod brothers would sidestep invaders and lead them deep inside the caves.<br />They would then show that there were, in fact, no precious ores to be found, and then explain the futility of invading.<br />The fact that they had the man with them helped them convince other humans, and thus, the trespassers promised not to attack the caves again – a promise they actually kept.<br />The brothers thanked the man for his help, forever grateful.

	<h4>A Cave-Forged Bond</h4>

	One day, the brothers heard of a drifting ship approaching the harbor town not too far from the caves. The ship had been wrecked during its voyage, but fortunately the crew and passengers had escaped in one piece. Among them was the man who had once helped them.<br /><br />The man told the brothers that something precious to him had been left aboard the ship. He wanted to return to it, but sea Beasts had commandeered the ship, so they couldn’t approach it without adequate preparation.<br /><br />To repay the man for his deeds, the brothers planned to sneak onto the ship and retrieve his prized possession. Unfortunately, the Beasts were incredibly strong, so the battle would be tough. As it turned out, the item the man coveted was the tool he had used while mining in the caves alongside the Dolmod brothers.<br />He had treasured that tool as a memento of his time with them, and he kept it with him at all times.<br />Upon learning this, the brothers knew that they had to retrieve it. Despite the difficult battle, the brothers managed to slip past the Beasts and successfully retrieve their friend’s precious tool.<br />He thanked them, and as a sign of his gratitude, he gifted them loads of alcohol and food he had picked up during his travels.<br />That night, the three brothers had a party, surrounded by the mountains of gifts they had received.<br />It is said that they had a toast to helping humans, whom they now knew weren’t so bad after all.
