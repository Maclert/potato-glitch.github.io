	A young man known as the "Strongest High School Primate" in another world.<br />Spending nearly 4000 years in a petrified state, he took down a lion with his bare hands moments after being revived. Tsukasa originally cooperated with Senku and his friends, but they went their separate paths.<br />The scientist was determined to bring back all of humanity, whereas the fighter wanted to go with the soft reset and make a new world without modern technology for the pure-hearted.<br />He obtained the recipe for the revival fluid and started a kingdom of ones he selected to be depetrified.
