	<h4>Hero of the Skies</h4>
	<strong>Unlock at Lv10</strong>
	<br /><br />
	Gravein suddenly appeared on the continent of Aldana during the age when humans and beasts were ruled by the God of Ruin.<br /><br />Though the shape of his wings and ears suggested the form of a beast, Gravein himself confirmed that he was neither man nor beast. He was a peculiar character in an age where no great effort was made by beasts or humans to resist the rule of the God of Ruin, who actively sought out opportunities to do battle with the God's henchmen as he piloted the Skyship Lonvalion across vast expanses.<br />Nobody really knew why Gravein maintained a skyship, or why he was always battling the God of Ruin's henchmen.<br /><br />When he first gained notoriety, Gravein only fought alone. However, the humans and beasts saved by his efforts began to refer to Gravein as 'The Sky Hero', and looked to him for strength.<br />Though many stepped forward to try and help Gravein, he rejected them all. Moreover, the budding hero could only be seen aboard the Skyship Lonvalion and there were very few capable of catching up to such a fast vessel.<br /><br />Yet there were still certain beasts and humans who continued to entreat Gravein, for him to accept their help. Despite initially rejecting all such requests, Gravein eventually ceased to complain when they forced themselves into his company; and just like that, he started to develop a regular following.<br />Despite some friction, the growing host of monsters and humans learned to collaborate with each other and continued to help Gravein surreptitiously.<br /><br />One of the humans who fought alongside Gravein left the following account of their adventures:<br />“Our beloved Sky Hero proved his worth as a leader, always meeting the enemy in battle with a natural stoicism.”<br /><br />His compatriots were not without criticism for their beloved hero, however, as one recounted:<br />“He (Gravein) was almost too unfeeling for his own good, and he was sometimes criticized for lacking empathy for others.”

	Records of his battles make it clear that though Gravein often refused to cooperate with others, he was not always unfriendly towards beasts and humans even when fighting alone.<br /><br />In the Gragia Mountains on the continent of Aldana, a regiment of Divine Soldiers bore down on a company of humans and beasts. At that time, humans and beasts were still weak and downtrodden and, lacking the ability to deal with the Divine Soldiers' sudden attack, they lost many in their company.<br />It was then that Gravein, piloting the Lonvalion, intervened. The sheer destructive power of the airship was enough to ensure victory, even against a force as strong as the Divine Soldiers.<br /><br />Yet in order to ensure that the surviving humans and beasts had enough time to flee to safety down the mountain, Gravein blocked the mountain path himself, bearing the brunt of the Divine Soldiers' fierce attack, and ultimately staving them off long enough for everyone to get away. Afterwards, Gravein fought alone, defeating all henchmen who remained.<br /><br />Records of the above battle serve as important proof that Gravein's rescue of the beleaguered humans and beasts was not merely part of a chance encounter. Thus, while fighting to defend the weak, Gravein developed tactics to ensure his own victor in battle while also cultivating the calm and patience he needed to deploy such tactics.<br /><br />Tales tell of one particular battle in which, while facing a large enemy host, Gravein was able to almost immediately decode their command and control system, after which he focused his attacks exclusively on commanding units.<br />Eventually all high priority targets succumbed and the enemy host, now without an effective commander, fell into disarray and was forced to retreat.<br /><br />It was precisely this level of insight and analytical intelligence demonstrated in the above anecdote, as well as the ability to understand the bigger picture, that earned Gravein the moniker of 'Sky Hero'.

	At first glance, Gravein might have appeared to function better as a "lone warrior," but one may also find accounts, anecdotal though they may be, of how certain beasts and humans who fell into his company saved Gravein in times of need.<br /><br />As Gravein met the Divine Soldiers in battle in the skies above Lanzelia, the enemy sought to surround and wipe out the young hero using a new strategy developed based on their previous failures. The Divine Soldiers' operation was a success and the Lonvalion sustained heavy damage to its mechanical systems. Gravein was on the verge of total defeat.<br /><br />Just as it seemed all was lost, a host of humans and beasts which had been following Gravein swooped in with the human warriors riding their winged beast companions through the sky, in an attempt to rescue Gravein.<br />Though records of the battle left behind by certain human warriors in some cases greatly exaggerated the number of Divine Soldiers defeated, the damage believed to have been sustained during the battle were left in the interior of the Lonvalion, adding credence to the theory that beasts and humans did in fact render aid to Gravein during the conflict.<br /><br />It is believed that Gravein's affinity for the beasts and humans who had come in his hour of need, gradually increased following the intense battle. The personal accounts of human warriors involved in the skirmish also serve as additional evidence of the above collaboration and tell of two humans with whom Gravein shared his battle plans. These two humans were perhaps the only people who Gravein considered worthy of respect, and with whom Gravein shared his thoughts.

	Gravein's illustrious combat record ended with a battle pitched in the skies over a great volcano on the continent of Mordana. According to records left behind by the humans who followed him, Gravein went toe-to-toe with a particularly powerful host of the God of Ruin's underlings. The servants of the terrible god were as swift as the wind and the humans and beasts sustained more and more damage as the skyship was unable to hold them off.<br /><br />It was then that they devised a plan: as Gravein restrained some of the god's henchmen using his own wings, two of his compatriots would unleash a brutal assault on the immobilized captives. <br />Although Gravein was successful in immobilizing his targets, unbeknownst to him and his allies, they had in fact fallen into a trap laid by the God of Ruin. The God of Ruin pierced Gravein's body as well as the bodies of the henchmen captured by Gravein, leaving the hero on the verge of death.<br /><br />Though the power of the beasts and humans was not enough to challenge the God of Ruin and the hero and his allies were on the brink of total destruction, the malevolent god, apparently satisfied with the injuries he had enacted on Gravein, vanished as suddenly as he had appeared, and Gravein's two honorary lieutenants rendered aid unto him.<br /><br />It was then that Gravein spoke his last words to them:<br />“Man and beast must never buckle under the destruction wrought by the God of Ruin; together we might resist his terrible power.”<br /><br />The two now-veterans of Gravein's final battle resolved to carry out the will of their former comrade-in-arms before boarding the skyship.<br /><br />Unfortunately, their account does not disclose what happened thereafter and it is not clear what ultimately became of the two humans. However, no longer alone, the humans and the beasts continued to operate the great airship which had been entrusted to them, as they continue to fight the God of Ruin and his demonic horde in and around Blaze.
