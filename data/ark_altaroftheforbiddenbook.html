	<h4>The Sealed Tome</h4>
	<strong>Unlock at Lv2</strong>
	<br /><br />
	Since time immemorial, there have been countless grimoires across Granzelia, but perhaps the most prominent among them is a grimoire of fire magic.<br />Its title is “Veladoma”.<br /><br />The grimoire’s existence has been told of since ancient times, but its location is still unknown. One theory says that the fire magic recorded within is so destructive that it could destroy the balance of the world, and thus it was forbidden and sealed away by an unknown party.<br />Naturally, such a powerful grimoire cannot simply be ignored. Countless sorcerers have searched for it, and many theories as to where the book was sealed away have come and gone throughout the ages.<br />Some claim the tome is sealed in a temple somewhere in the Malboria Mountains, while others suppose it may be enshrined in an altar deep below the surface of the Mordana Sand Sea. However, the grimoire has not been discovered at any of its theorized locations.<br /><br />This grimoire takes its name from the sorcerer Veladoma, who recorded the magic she had developed within its pages. Veladoma lived during a time when the God of Wounds was still sealed away, and she was such a well-known expert in fire magic that none were considered her equal.<br />Even in modern times, she is regarded as one of the Ten Masters who laid the foundation for magic before the God of Ruin’s tyrannical reign. However, she was known to have quite a unique personality, and her many idiosyncrasies surprised the people of her time.<br />Many stories of her antics exist to this day, giving us insight into what sort of person she may have been.

	<h4>Too Stubborn</h4>
	<strong>Unlock at Lv4</strong>
	<br /><br />
	Here is one surviving anecdote about Veladoma:<br /><br />One day, she was gathering materials for magic development, but one item in particular was simply too hard to find: the scale of Ragzard, a giant dragon said to have lived since ancient times. The ancient dragon flew tirelessly through Granzelia’s skies, rarely landing on solid ground.<br />Fortunately for Veladoma, Ragzard was in its yearlong, once-in-a-millenium hibernation in the mountains.<br />This was the ideal time for her to obtain a scale, but it didn’t mean her journey would be without incident.<br /><br />In his slumber, Ragzard was surrounded by a giant wall of ice. The wall towered above the clouds, and the intense snowstorms there made it impossible for humans to surmount. <br />The wall itself was extraordinarily thick and seemed impossible to breach through conventional means. Thus, Veladoma began spending long hours developing fire magic strong enough to melt the ice wall.<br /><br />Although Veladoma succeeded, she then declared, “Is this the best I can do? This is unacceptable!”<br /><br />Unsatisfied with her merely sufficient fire magic, Veladoma continued her research to make it even more powerful. Eventually, she developed unfathomably powerful magic that was on a completely different scale from her original spell. However, by the time she had finished her second version, the giant dragon Ragzard had already awoken from its slumber and flown away, rendering the melting of the ice wall completely unnecessary.<br />But Veladoma herself had already forgotten about the dragon and was wholly satisfied with the magic she had created.

	<h4>Research Methods</h4>
	<strong>Unlock at Lv7</strong>
	<br /><br />
	Veladoma stands out because she hardly ever secluded herself in her room in order to conduct research.<br />She was the rare sort of sorcerer who would always place herself in the midst of battles and adventurers to gain new inspiration for her magic.<br /><br />“Hm, I think everyone’s got their own style when it comes to research, but I can’t get anything done locked up in my room. It’s too cramped in there to think.”<br /><br />Veladoma would often say things like this, which is why she always had her grimoire on hand so she could write down any thoughts or ideas as they came to mind.<br />Thus, her grimoire was marred by various wear and tear. Beast claw marks could be found throughout the book – not just on the covers, but on individual pages as well. There’s even a story that says a Beast would’ve dealt her a fatal blow if it weren’t for the grimoire in her breast pocket.<br />Incidentally, Veladoma wrote many books besides her forbidden grimoire. To this day, researchers investigate every single mark and scuff on these books to find clues as to where Veladoma may have been.

	<h4>In Mourning</h4>
	<strong>Unlock at Lv10</strong>
	<br /><br />
	After Veladoma’s death, her grimoires and other books left in her laboratory were entrusted to her fellow sorcerer friends. There were vast numbers of these tomes, but when her friends checked them, the majority were merely memos and notes with ambiguous meanings.<br /><br />Hidden among these books was the prototype of what would later be called the “Grimoire Veladoma”, but there are two theories about how it came to be.<br />The first is that out of all of Veladoma’s books, just one happened to enumerate the details of her magic.<br />The other is that Veladoma’s lover somehow managed to decipher the obscure notes she had written.<br /><br />Proponents of the former theory argue that nobody else could simply decipher the magic Veladoma had developed, while proponents of the latter point out that Veladoma’s lover was also a fire sorcerer just like she was.<br />But since the whereabouts of the “Grimoire Veladoma” is unknown to begin with, the truth remains a mystery with no way of investigating.<br /><br />The “Grimoire Veladoma” was a hot topic among sorcerers at the time of its unveiling and is said to have passed through the hands of many great sorcerers, but as stated before, the tome was forbidden by someone and sealed away.<br />The fact that it was important enough to banish shows just how much everyone valued the book.<br />It is said that even gods covet the grimoire or find it dangerous.
