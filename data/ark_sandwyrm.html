	<h4>The Desert Beast of Ruin</h4>
	<strong>Unlock at Lv2</strong>
	<br /><br />
	There are a variety of Beasts living in the Dara Desert region that like the peculiar composition of its dirt.<br />Grandworms are one such Beast, having lived in the desert since ancient times. Legend has it that one possessed a particularly fearsome power and ran rampant during the age when humanity was oppressed under the God of Ruin’s tyranny.<br /><br />From the texts of Beast researchers at the time, we can confirm that this grandworm was more than ten times bigger than the rest of its kind, and that it could swallow many people at once.<br />There were even times when it would wreak havoc on towns by devouring entire buildings.<br /><br />It had some special characteristics as well: the ability to travel underground at high speeds despite its large body, and it would crunch whatever it could between its venomous fangs.<br />It is said that this grandworm used its astonishing destructive power to stand off against numerous Beasts and humans, killing them without mercy.<br /><br />After its long years of slaughter, it was nicknamed the “Sandwyrm” by those who feared it.<br />But humanity did not falter, and many soldiers continued to try to defeat it.

	<h4>Heroic Epilogue</h4>
	<strong>Unlock at Lv4</strong>
	<br /><br />
	Allegedly, the grandworms that roamed with the Sandwyrm would relentlessly eliminate anything that stepped into their territory – be they Beast, human, or followers of the God of Ruin.<br />It is hypothesized that the reason the God of Ruin didn’t retaliate when the grandworms attacked its followers, was because it had actually brought the grandworms to life and enjoyed watching the violent battles between worm and human; however, there is no way of verifying the truth.<br /><br />In any event, it goes without saying that while suffering under the God of Ruin’s tyranny, humanity had yet another creature to fear in the grandworms, which even the followers of the God of Ruin would not attack.<br />And yet, humanity could not remain silent under the heavy oppression of both the Beasts and the God of Ruin’s followers. Determined, they made many attempts to defeat the Sandwyrm.<br /><br />First, they tried group tactics.<br />However, this had no effect against the agile Sandwyrm, and the humans wound up being toyed with instead. As they were stuck in groups, the humans were not able to move about freely, and the Sandwyrm ended up catching multiple people at once between its fangs.<br />As a result, the humans lost their nerve, and entrusted the subjugation of the Sandwyrm to mighty heroes who were famous for slaying Beasts.<br /><br />However, even with their power, the heroes had to deal with the Sandwyrm by using extraordinary means. It is said that the heroes were confident in their abilities, having successfully slain so many Beasts before, and it was typical for them to head into battle alone.<br />The fight with the Sandwyrm was no exception – the heroes went one by one to see who would manage to defeat it.<br /><br />While the heroes prioritized saving the common people from the Beast, it was also important to them to make their valor known to the world. However, those who went to challenge the Sandwyrm left the field, having been completely defeated from the offset of the battle.<br />Some had their prized weapons swallowed up, while others ran away, unable to fight because their weapons had been destroyed, much to their chagrin.<br />They were all brought down a peg or two by having gone through such a bitter experience.

	<h4>Fangs and Blades</h4>
	<strong>Unlock at Lv7</strong>
	<br /><br />
	As the heroes suffered one defeat after another at the fangs of the Sandwyrm, a lone warrior thus set out to defeat it.<br />They wielded dual blades, and had fought and won over 100 battles against Beasts. The hero’s blades were said to be able to crush any Beast’s claws or fangs.<br />The battle between the grandworm possessing the most sinister of fangs, and the strongest dual-wielding warrior had begun.<br /><br />The Sandwyrm made the first strike. It traveled effortlessly between underground and aboveground terrain, making sport of the warrior by using its favored tactic of sowing confusion.<br />The warrior barely parried the Beast’s relentless attacks, but they had not cut down so many Beasts up until now merely for show. While keeping up their defense, the warrior was calculating the grandworm’s speed and the range of its offensive attacks.<br />They patiently waited for the perfect opportunity to make their counterattack.<br /><br />And then finally, when the Beast was making its way toward the surface again, they seized the opportunity to strike.<br />The ferocity of the exchange of fangs and blades increased with every blow, with neither giving an inch as they continued their dance of offense and defense.<br />The Sandwyrm had one more trick up its sleeve. It sprayed a deadly poison at the warrior, planning to end the battle in one move.<br /><br />However, the warrior did not panic. They deflected the spray with one blade and pierced the Sandwyrm with the other while it was preoccupied with its poisonous assault.<br />The grandworm collapsed on the spot and poison began gushing into the wound. It struggled against its own poison, which penetrated the wound, before finally stopping all movement.<br /><br />And so, the grandworm that had caused so much suffering for so long was defeated. Furthermore, the particulars of this battle, as told by the triumphant hero, were put together to form a heroic saga.

	<h4>Secret of the Sand Beast</h4>
	<strong>Unlock at Lv10</strong>
	<br /><br />
	After the warrior’s victory, Beast scholars began researching and studying the grandworm’s remains.<br />Whether it was a coincidence or an orchestration that such a giant grandworm suddenly appeared is unknown, but as a result of the research, a scholar at the time pointed out that it may have obtained a strong Ether of some sort from an outside source.<br />And so, it has come to be a commonly accepted theory even now that as a result of the Ether, the Sandwyrm’s very flesh became a weapon, and it gained the power to spray poison.<br /><br />The question is, if it was intentional, who gave it the Ether, and for what purpose?<br />Even now, there are multiple theories to try to answer these questions.<br /><br />One is that the God of Ruin or one of its followers gave the grandworm Ether to inflict more torment on humanity,a nd then they couldn’t control its rampages afterward.<br />It is said that among its followers, there were those who enjoyed watching humans fight and meet their demise against Beasts they could not defeat, so it would not have been unusual for one of them to have incited the grandworm’s wrath.<br /><br />There are other theories that say an inexperienced sorcerer was trying to create a new spell using the geological features of the Dara Desert but accidentally powered up the grandworm instead.<br />These theories stemmed from rumors at the time that experiments were being done on new technologies for the development of humanity at a research institute located somewhere close to the desert.<br />It is said that, since their research was done in secret, the sorcerer was able to abscond before his error could be brought to light.<br /><br />Also, there were confirmed traces that the Sandwyrm had given birth before its battle with the warrior.<br />It’s not for certain whether it passed on the power of the Ether to its offspring. If it did, though, then there is a big chance that its children will appear someday once they have fully grown to threaten humanity again.
