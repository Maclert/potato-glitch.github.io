	<h4>The Mutant Species</h4>
	<strong>Unlock at Lv10</strong>
	<br /><br />
	Records tell of certain mutant Gobl specimens which feature abnormally developed physiologies.<br />Though their intelligence is roughly the same as a typical Gobl, their ferocity far exceeds that of their smaller cousins. Hobgobls can grow to gargantuan sizes, towering over the average human and possessing a muscular strength far above its Gobl brethren.<br />Any ordinary soldier who dared attack such a specimen from the front would surely suffer a crippling defeat.<br /><br />These mutants also possess a strong desire to dominate other Gobl and can often be found leading groups. Whether it's because of their insatiable desire to dominate their peers, or because of their small numbers, Hobgobl are unable to form groups among themselves even if they are capable of leading other Gobl.<br /><br />Some have also theorized that the above behavior arises from an instinctive awareness among the Gobl. A critical ecological balance amongst the Gobls would be lost when stronger specimens are concentrated into a single group.

	<h4>Flock Leader</h4>
	<strong>Unlock at Lv30</strong>
	<br /><br />
	A typical example of the process by which a Hobgobl becomes the leader of a group of Gobl is discussed below.<br /><br />Individuals within a group of Gobl who have abnormally evolved into a Hobgobl are traditionally expelled from the group. Various theories have been proposed as to why the above behavior occurs.<br />One popular theory posits that Hobgobl are expelled in order to cultivate the power needed to lead a group, by surviving as an individual for a period of time.<br /><br />Once an expelled Hobgobl finishes the growth process and is ready to lead a group, it will drive out the older Hobgobl already leading the group, and effectively take over the group's leadership role. The new Hobgobl leader will continue his duties until the next generation produces a leader worthy of leading the group.<br />The above is just one example of how leader succession works in a Gobl group, and there are in fact many other ways that succession may play out.<br /><br />For example, there have reportedly been cases in which they will test their might by 'practicing' taking over a group led by a younger Hobgobl, or employ various stratagems to chase out another Hobgobl who has already lost the confidence of his underlings.<br />After becoming the group leader, a Hobgobl will guide his pack and keep it safe; fight ferociously on the front lines when conducting raids on human encampments; and engage in other behaviors which a normal Gobl would be entirely incapable of.<br /><br />Some have also claimed that while in a group comprising of only Gobl, the name of each member of the group is decided by the leader. In groups led by a Hobgobl, the leader's name is given to him by his underlings as a sign of respect and familiarity.

	<h4>Struggles</h4>
	<strong>Unlock at Lv50</strong>
	<br /><br />
	It is generally well known that unlike fights with groups comprising of only Gobl, fights with groups of Gobl led by a Hobgobl tend to be extremely fierce.<br />Many records exist of conflicts with such groups around villages proximal to Hobgobl territory.<br /><br />Hobgobl are just as good at keeping their subordinates in line as rumors would suggest. Because they lack human intelligence, Hobgobl are virtually incapable of using advanced strategies, but they are good at motivating their subordinates. Many village records tell of how hard it is to engage Gobl whipped into a frenzy by an effective leader.<br /><br />Additionally, Hobgobl are widely known not only for their strong desire for domination and control, but also taking good care of their subordinates.<br />Though Hobgobl vary from individual to individual, they are not known to order attacks that might put their companions in harm's way, even when motivated by the promise of rare treasure.<br /><br />In one battle between a village militia and a Hobgobl-led pack, Gobl which straggled behind their fleeing comrades are reported to have been helped by their leader, who apparently did not want to leave them behind under any circumstances.<br />Many experts believe that it is their seemingly warm regard for their friends, in addition to their fearsome and overwhelming power, that commands so much respect among the subordinates of a good Hobgobl leader.

	<h4>Unique Customs</h4>
	<strong>Unlock at Lv80</strong>
	<br /><br />
	Hobgobl-led groups show a number of interesting characteristics in the way they go about their daily life when not on the battlefield.<br />As with any other Gobl pack, such groups tend to live deep within forests and caves.<br />Their daily lives in such places are reported to include certain unique customs.<br /><br />Records tell of one particularly interesting incident which befell a traveler while he was making his way through the forest. The traveler knew he would be unable to make it out of the forest before sundown, and so decided to pass the night in a nearby cave.<br />Just as he was about to finally fall asleep, the traveler noticed that he could hear some kind of strange noise coming from an area deeper into the cave. Though the traveler was afraid and knew that he should proceed with caution, he was even more curious to discover the source of the noise and so walked deeper into the depths of the cave.<br /><br />He eventually came upon a circle of Gobl led by a Hobgobl, and in the middle of the circle lay several objects which appeared to have been looted from a human encampment. Of course, there have been many such accounts of human travelers mistakenly stumbling into the territory of a pack of Gobl, but what makes this particular story interesting is that this traveler reported hearing the Gobl singing a kind of song.<br /><br />Unfortunately, upon hearing the manâ€™s footsteps the Gobl immediately stopped singing and chased him out, so he was only able to hear a fragment of the song, but what the traveler did hear he retained in his memory clearly. He is said to have popularized the tune after returning to his hometown without incident.<br /><br />A later investigation determined that the song which the man heard is in fact an original tune sung among different Hobgobl-led groups, suggesting that collectively such groups may exhibit sufficient intelligence to create their own unique culture.<br />It is unclear whether the above development represents a new evolution in their long history, or the song is simply the continuation of a longer tradition to which humans have not until now been privy.<br />Such questions will require further research to answer.
