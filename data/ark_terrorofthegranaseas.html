	Located to the northeast of Port Town Granada is the Grana Sea, an important location for fishermen and merchants alike.<br /><br />This spot in the sea has many folktales and left an impact in tradition as well. While many ships pass through, most consider those stories as nothing more than old wives’ tales. These were merely superstitions until one sailor came about.<br /><br />This shipwrecked sailor was clinging to a barrel, drifting aimlessly in what was considered the heart of the Grana Sea. After being rescued by a passing ship and taken to the closest harbor, the crew finally asked the man what had happened.<br /><br />“I was assigned to a crew to deliver cargo to Lanzelia. The fog rolled in and the waves grew calm. Some crewmates were with me, we were cleaning the deck and organizing the rigging. Idle chatter, just another day out at sea, nothing strange even if the waves weren’t rolling. I was talkin’ to the guy ont he rigging, he suddenly went quiet. I asked if he somehow fell into the water, but when I looked back to where he was… it must’ve been larger than the ship herself.<br />That monster, with countless tendrils. We were all speechless. Then before anyone could raise an alarm, it dragged the crew closest to it into the depths. I was a coward! I happened to be near the empty barrels and I just jumped into one and made myself small. The rest of the crew came bustling out by then, I could recognize each of their screams and shouts as they tried to fend the thing off. I got a mouthful of seawater when my barrel was knocked off the deck. But their screams, the ship splintering apart, I can still hear it ringing in my ears.”<br /><br />Of course, nobody had believed the shipwrecked man, chalking it all up to hallucinations. However, after a few reports of ships not making it to their destined port across the Grana Sea, people renewed their beliefs in the tall tales; of the many beasts that may lurk beneath the water’s surface. Sailors were once again wary while out at sea.

	After witnessing oddly frequent incidents regarding the Grana Sea, the local merchants turned to the Holy Kingdom. As the current ruler of the continent, the kingdom dispatched a naval fleet to investigate.<br />The Navy arrived at Granada and listened to the merchants and sailors who claimed to have seen the terrifying beast. The admiral assumed their stories were exaggerated and it was merely an “oversized beastly illusion”. The fleet admiral then sent three heavily armed warships and two frigates out to the Grana Sea.<br /><br />Two days later, only one of the faster ships made it back to port with half of the crew remaining. With both his body and pride wounded, the admiral finally took the merchant’s words to heart as he reported back to the Holy Kingdom.<br /><br />The ships had arrived upon the location known as the Grana Sea according to schedule. The crew had reported that a heavy fog had rolled in and the waves were eerily still. One of the frigates sent ahead to scout had reported two lights under the water. <br />Moments later, that ship was entangled in the tentacles of the kraken-like beast. <br />The crew panicked as the sails were torn apart and the once-sturdy masts creaked and snapped. That was more than enough to raise the alarm that the beast had shown itself. As the beast was busy sinking that ship, the crew was ordered to relentlessly fire. The cannons had little effect on something so huge. The appendages then went for the closest warship, battling the crew on the cannon deck as the hull of the ship creaked. Some of the crew fought back with their own firearms and swords, but they did nothing more than irritate the beast.<br /><br />And surely enough, the beast rose above the water, dwarfing the main mast and its sails. The surrounding ships had also began firing at the beast, aiming for the eyes. The crew of the warship in its grasp was as good as dead at that point. In a final blow, the ship snapped in half from the beast’s enraged lashings. <br /><br />Amidst frantic shouting, the remaining three ships decided that at the least, the quickest ship and the admiral should survive to report back to the Holy Kingdom. The admiral made their way to the remaining frigate by a small lifeboat, all the while watching his crew fight back the monster. Cannonballs flew over his head and as soon as the admiral got on board, he choked out the order, “Return to port.”<br />The crew on the remaining frigate reluctantly left the two warships to their watery graves. The captains of the warships stood tall as they let the quickest ship escape with the admiral.<br /><br />While lamenting over the death of the crews and captains, the admiral sent the somber report.

	The admiral’s mournful story was heard all throughout Granzelia: the Holy Kingdom’s Navy was nearly useless against the sea-beast. <br />With this defeat, the merchants gave up hope. Instead of fighting, they began to search for ways around the beast’s foggy territory.<br /><br />On a fateful day, one peculiar ship was docked on Granada’s harbors. A single man was in the town square, causing a ruckus. This man was known as Doura, who sported a blazing blue beard.<br />“Which one of ye sent fer me?” Doura bellowed with a crumpled piece of parchment in hand. <br /><br />The townspeople, distressed, summoned for the Navy, and one man eventually stepped forward.<br />A man, who was clearly traumatized, and who had seen crewmen die at the hands of the beast.<br />The navy’s admiral.<br /><br />The letter had stated how the Holy Kingdom’s fleets were no match for the beast. With the scrawled parchment, the admiral had begged the pirate king to defeat the sea-beast and avenge the countless lost lives. Of course, if the news of the navy asking a pirate for help ever reached the Holy Kingdom, they’d have the admiral publicly executed.<br />But the loss of his own life mattered little to this broken man.<br /><br />“Must be loaded ’t the gunwhales to be askin’ a pirate for a favor.”<br />Doura confronted the disheartened man.<br />Sadness over the loss of the crews.<br />Anger towards the tentacled beast.<br />Regret and shame for being unable to do anything but run.<br />The pirate king knew that look all too well. He laid a hand on the admiral’s shoulder.<br />“Leave it to me an’ my crew.”<br /><br />Hiccuping his gratitude, the admiral finally let his tears fall.<br /><br />In a week, multiple pirate fleets gathered under Doura’s command, all closing in on the beast’s territory. As they arrived, the ships formed a ring around the territory to keep the tentacled beast from fleeing without a fight.<br />The beast showed itself, towards the northern end of the encirclement – but its appearance had already been anticipated.<br /><br />“Fire the harpoons!”<br /><br />Doura’s voice rang out over the waves.<br />Each harpoon fired was lodged into the beast’s body. The pirate king had guessed that the Holy Kingdom’s Navy was unable to defeat the beast because they were unable to capture and keep it in one place. Doura’s plan was to corner it like a galley rat, and relentlessly pound it with cannons.<br />At Doura’s command, the chains stopped the tentacled beast from diving beneath the waves and escaping in the murky deep. <br />Screams from the farthest ship were almost drowned out in the cannon fire. Peering back, Doura realised that the captured sea-beast wasn’t alone.<br />A different tentacled beast was crushing the battleship.

	The appearance of the second beast broke their formation. The pirates were forced to let the first tentacled beast escape. Now two kraken-like beasts were angered, each going after different ships in the ring. Calling the remaining ships close, Doura used the chains that once held the beast to keep the ships together. Side by side, the ships gathered near the Black Legnis. All close together that the crew could easily jump from deck to deck. The two angered beasts went towards the cluster of ships. One ship after another fired away when they got close.<br />Amidst the chaos, Doura gave commands to use the harpoon again and to drag both beasts onto the decks. In doing so, the beasts spewed a paralyzing mucus but Doura and his crew resisted. With his crew, Doura yelled over the noise.<br /><br />“This be the time ye show how we pirates do battle! Aye give ‘em no quarter! Show ‘em us seadogs’ll put up a fight better than the Navy! Show ‘em who really be rulin’ the seas! Blow ‘em down!”<br /><br />The crew went wild with those words. Taking up arms and all working in tandem. Hacking away at the beast in what may be the final onslaught between life and death. After what felt like hours, the battle came to an end. The two beasts let out their final cries as their heartbeats came to a stop.<br /><br />Covered in wounds, the pirate king and his crew made it back to Granada with the remains of the two terrifying beasts in tow. Upon hearing that Doura had successfully returned, the admiral of the Navy rushed to thank the pirate king. Finding Doura looking saddened, the admiral asked how much of Doura’s crews had been lost. Raising an eyebrow, the man in blue simply answered, “They were mates.”<br />The admiral inquired as to what he meant.<br />“The two of ‘em, a pair. They ‘prolly had eggs ’n brats t’ raise. A family, the lot of ‘em.”<br />Looking forlornly at the two beastly carcasses, the admiral felt a pang of sorrow and went quiet.<br /><br />“I wouldn’t be that worried ‘f I were ye. It’d take ‘em years t’ grow t’ that size. By the time yer dead they’ll be thrivin’ an’ it ain’t our problem then.”<br /><br />With those words, the pirate king climbed back on board the Legnis, leaving the carcasses at the port with the admiral.<br /><br />Years have indeed passed, and now more ships have gone missing in the Grana Sea…
