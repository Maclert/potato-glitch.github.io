	<h4>A Clash Between Gods</h4>
	<strong>Unlock at Lv2</strong>
	<br /><br />
	The Treasure Sword of Eliud is known as the favorite sword of Seirios, who once challenged the God of Ruin alongside Melza the White Knight.<br />This weapon felled countless numbers of the god’s followers.<br />Legends of the blade were just as great as those of its master, but it was not originally his sword.<br /><br />The sword was said to have been enshrined in a certain cave in the Lanzelian Mountains.<br />Why would the Treasure Sword of Eliud be sleeping in the frigid cold of a mountain range?<br />The answers lies within the conflict between two ancient gods, one which dates back even further than the God of Ruin’s tyrannical reign.<br /><br />Granzelia was once caught in a battle for hegemony between the God of Ice and the God of Fire. The two were equally matched in strength, and the fight raged on as though it would never end. Therefore, each god sought to concentrate their might into one fatal, decisive strike.<br />They concluded that the best way to do this would be to forge divine swords imbued with their own power. Thus, the God of Ice forged the Sword of Ice, and the God of Fire forged the Sword of Fire.<br /><br />The battle escalated as the two gods swung their swords, both fully aware of what a direct hit would do. Blade clashed against blade, with each shockwave shaking the entire continent of Granzelia, bringing ruin to the environment.<br />When the battle began to threaten the entire world, the gods of the earth stepped in to intervene.<br />The warring gods begrudgingly agreed to a ceasefire.<br />It is said that as a symbol of their peace, each god sealed their divine sword.

	Thanks to the intervention of the gods of the earth, the God of Ice and the God of Fire agreed to a ceasefire and peace was temporarily restored. However, that did not mean that the two gods had completely given up on their quest for mutual annihilation.<br />The two of them sought opportunities to resume their conflict after the ceasefire, but the watchful eyes of the gods of the earth were too strict, and thus the belligerent gods were unable to make a move.<br /><br />However, the God of Ice realized that even though he himself could not make a move, perhaps someone else could in his stead. Therefore, he set his sights on a particular human.<br />This human excelled in the art of war, and possessed both strong magic and a strong body. The God of Ice instructed the man to unseal his divine sword – while evading the eyes of the gods of the earth – and destroy the God of Fire.<br /><br />Breaking the sword’s seal and defeating the God of Fire would be long and treacherous tasks for a mere human. But at the end of his long journey, the man reached the God of Fire with the Sword of Ice in hand, as he had been commanded.<br />However, before him stood a human holding the divine Sword of Fire.<br /><br />The God of Fire had similarly plotted to use a human to defeat the God of Ice. The humans, representatives of each god, began their epic battle with a mutual strike.<br />The Swords of Fire and Ice clashed yet again, causing tremendous damage across Granzelia.

	<h4>Sealed Annihilation</h4>

	Why were the God of Ice and the God of Fire fighting for hegemony in the first place? There are various theories.<br />In the beginning, it seems that both gods were powerful leaders, and each of them protected world order. Allegedly, at the summit of the gods, it was suggested that they both rule together.<br /><br />But somewhere along the way, they had a difference of opinions, and one of them stole a march on the other.<br />That is one such theory as to the start of the war between the gods. Even among proponents of this theory, opinion is split over which of the two gods was the first to go on the offensive.<br />One thing is for certain, though: the war between the gods caused more and more destruction to Granzelia the longer it drew on.<br /><br />Once their war by proxy was over, many gods who surveyed the damage, including the gods of the earth, deemed that it would not be enough this time to simply seal away the two divine swords.<br />The gods finally moved to bring ruin to the God of Ice and the God of Fire.<br />The two gods sensed something was awry, and joined forces to defeat their common enemy.<br /><br />The God of Ice and the God of Fire had been trying to slay one another for ages, so their intimate knowledge of one another’s movements allowed them to coordinate exceptionally well. However, they were severely outnumbered, so their perseverance did not save them from failure.<br />It is said that the God of Ice and the God of Fire each sealed away their divine swords and secured them in a remote region where no human could find them.

	<h4>Revival of the Holy Sword</h4>
	<strong>Unlock at Lv10</strong>
	<br /><br />
	Eons passed after the battle between the God of Ice and the God of Fire, bringing us to the age of Seirios’ adventures.<br />During this time, a ferocious Beast would often appear in Lanzelia. Seirios tried to defeat it, but he could not properly face Beasts with the sword he had at the time. <br />He began to gather information on how he could obtain a stronger sword.<br /><br />Eventually, Seirios found an ancient document in the underground archive of Lanzelia Castle; from it, he learned of a divine sword that had been imbued with the power of a god, and hidden in a faraway place.<br />The document was ancient and seemed to contain more of a myth than recorded history, so the information was dubious. However, Seirios gambled on that sliver of hope and set his sights on the divine sword’s resting place.<br /><br />The quest for the divine sword was treacherous, with Beasts springing at him from every corner along the way. But the more he fought, the better Seirios became with the sword.<br /><br />At last, he reached the cave in the Lanzelia Mountains where the sword was said to be sleeping. There, he once again had to face a Beast.<br />This Beast blocked his path as if to protect the cave’s entrance. Seirios somehow managed to evade the Beast’s attacks, and saw the sword he had been looking for deep within the cave.<br /><br />The Beast pursued him and launched a fierce attack his way; at the same time, Seirios reached for the sword buried in the ice.<br />The moment he touched it, the ice thawed and the sword fit perfectly into his palm, as though it had been made for him.<br />With a single swing of his sword, Seirios cut the Beast clean in two. Because of his affinity with the divine weapon, some say that Seirios may have shared blood with the first human chosen by the God of Ice to wield it.<br /><br />Sword of Ice in hand, he looked down at the Beast that had nearly defeated him, his victory ascertained.<br />It seemed as if fate had guided him to the Sword of Ice, and its newly confirmed existence also suggested the existence of its legendary counterpart, the Sword of Fire.<br />But what would be required to obtain the Sword of Fire?
