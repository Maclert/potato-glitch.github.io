		<p><h1>Skill guide</h1></p>
		<p>This page intends to explain most skills in terms of core builds, branching builds, and recommended practices.</p>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>Core builds</strong> are skills that should be included unless certain circumstances demand otherwise.</li>
			<li><strong>Branching builds</strong> represent certain popular builds that can be catered to most units.</li>
			<li><strong>Recommended practices</strong> include recommended equipment, current/future meta, and other specifics.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>If you are reading this guide for an Arena (PvP) build, be aware that Arena demands certain metas to the extent of compromising basic build principles (i.e. a mage carrying healing spells is usable in Arena but not anywhere else). <strong>A guide to Arena is available on <a href="https://potato-glitch.github.io/tiers">the tier list</a>.</strong></p>

		<h2>Mage skill guide</h2>
		<p>Mages are units that focus exclusively on attack magic to the exclusion of everything else that requires MP. Pure mages are units like Popoi, Lily, Eliza and Dyne.</p>
		<p>There are <strong>THREE</strong> things to keep in mind when building a mage.</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Your main elements are powerful because of stacked damage and INT buffs. Stack them as much as you can. Invest in equipment.</li>
			<li>MP management is critical. No MP = no damage.</li>
			<li>Element resistance is a flat damage reduction on the final damage. For example, 100 light resist = 1 light damage dealt, regardless of how many damage modifiers you have equipped. Therefore, always plan your party around the content you're facing.</li>

		<h2>Physical DPS skill guide</h2>
		<p>Physical DPS units focus primarily on regular attacks and/or physical skills. As there are many sub-variants, this guide will focus on popular builds only.</p>
		<h4>Trishula builds</h4>
		<p>Trishula is a Machine weapon and ark ether reward from Kaldina the Great (SSR) ark.</p>
		<p>Trishula is mandatory for any physical DPS that isn't Neutral element because Trishula allows elemental damage to bypass enemies' element resistances. Trishula does not activate on ≥100 resist enemies, but you can bypass that by casting Weak (-20 resist for 40 seconds). Dual Wield is recommended for Trishula units.</p>
		<p>Trishula only affects physical skills. When you have Trishula equipped, your skills will ignore resistances. Trishula doesn't debuff the enemy or reduce the enemy's resistance to 0. Only one unit in the party can benefit from Trishula at any time, so be aware of your party composition.</p>

			<h4 id="pdps-branch-break" class="text-center">Branch: Break & faint</h4>
			<p>Break refers to a boss's break bar, and faint refers to an invisible bar that determines a mob's break bar. In harder content, breaking and fainting is essential to deal damage and/or protect the party from being wiped. Certain units (i.e. Vaughn) are specifically designed for exploiting this mechanic.</p>
			<p>For a better idea on which units should pursue a Break/Faint build, see the <a href="https://potato-glitch.github.io/tiers">tier list</a>.</p>
			<p>Most buffs for a Break/Faint build are on equipment and ark passives (Terror in the Grana Seas or Phoenix Blow) rather than skills.</p>
			<h5 class="text-muted">Further information</h5>
			<p class="text-muted">If you are familiar with the game, an incomplete breakdown of unit physical skills sorted by SCT and Break value is <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1bWBrYIUxx2Vyt8OrSwX_0LfPoYOAHSYaEOUJe1ZVdKg/edit">available here</a>. A user on Discord compiled it from the JP datamine and I sorted it. As is the case with datamines, the information presented may not be accurate, so don't take it at face value. For example, the duration of skill animations (not available in the datamine) also affects how fast units can break enemies. Nor are talent buffs (i.e. for Vaughn) included.</p>

			<h4 id="pdps-branch-autos" class="text-center">Branch: Regular attacks</h4>
			<p>Regular attacks are the auto attacks that your unit does when you tap the Attack button.</p>
			<p>Some units have much better auto-attacking than others because of faster animation and more hits. For example, DXR-MK02 with its 5 hits per auto-attack is generally considered the best auto-attack in the game, even though DXR does no damage.</p>
			<p>Regular attack builds can be incredibly strong, but they require significant SC investment. A number of important passives (i.e. Sharp Eyes) don't affect regular attacks either.</p>
			<p>Ailment-causing research passives are generally paired with regular attack builds. For example, Phal's innate Stun Research led players to build her for regular attacks.</p>

			<p>Impacts are passives that allow a PDPS unit to do additional hits/damage on their auto-attacks (regular attacks).</p>

		<h2>Tank skill guide</h2>
		<p>Tanks are increasingly auxiliary when faced with damage powercreep. However, tanks are still relevant for survival in Tower and other difficult content. Their presence alone allows a player to potentially soft-reset a fight by sustaining until Yggdrasil summon is ready to be used.</p>
		<h4>Hybrid builds</h4>
		<p>Certain units are designed to be hybrid tank/damage dealers, such as Zouglas. Since unit usage is dependant on the content you are facing, you will want to build them as both tank and DPS so that you can swap their skillsets as needed. Refer to the physical DPS or mage guides.</p>
		<h4>Equipment and arks</h4>
		<p>Unlike other roles, tanks rely heavily on the assistance of equipment – such as Auto Regeneration from an accessory, or additional Allure stacks from armor and accessories.</p>
		<p>A good rule of thumb is to stack as many Allure (aggro) buffs as you can, since there is no cap. Cactus Hammer is also an excellent weapon for pure tanks with its 25% chance to stun on normal attack.</p>

			<p>Guard is a mechanic where when a unit stops moving/attacking, Guard has a chance of proccing when the unit receives damage.</p>
			<p>Guard is usually reserved for tanks as tanks are there to soak damage. However, as Guard requires a number of sub-passives to function well, investing in a Guard build will take a considerable amount of SC.</p>
			<h5>Equipment</h5>
			<p>Automatic Guard accessories are plentiful in the game, but they are generally bait since equipping one only saves 1SC from not having to equip Guard.</p>
			<p>Aigis Shield, the ark ether reward from Golem Core (SSR), is the single best accessory for any Guard tank. Pair it with a HP regeneration accessory or the ether reward from Wishes on a Holy Night (SSR).</p>
