		<p><h1>Beginner's guide</h1></p>
		<p>This page consolidates most of the launch advice, Greensburg's <a href="https://gamepress.gg/last-cloudia-beginners-guide">beginner's guide</a>, and my experience as a regular in #gl-help on Discord.</p>
		<p>If you are a new player, this page was written for you.</p>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>The basics</strong> is for explaining the various configurations and menu options available.</li>
			<li><strong>The walkthrough</strong> is for all new players up to their first level 80 units.</li>
			<li><strong>The crystal spending guide</strong> has tips on how to maximise crystal efficiency for players who don't spend much, or at all.</li>
			<li><strong>The reroll guide</strong> is for players who want to understand why certain arks are preferred over others for a "starting account". This section is written from the perspective of a gacha player for other gacha players.</li>
		</ul>
		<h4>Where do I ask other questions?</h4>
		<p>Ask in #gl-help on <a href="https://discord.gg/hYGG9Gt">Discord</a> or in the Questions megathread on <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/lastcloudia/">Reddit</a>.</p>
		<p>For any questions specific to the guide itself, ping @potato (me) on Discord. I don't have a Reddit account. <span class="text-white">You can DM me on Discord if you need to.</span></p>

					<p>Gachas use <strong>paid crystals</strong> or <strong>free crystals</strong>. The rates are the same, but paid crystals can be discounted, such as the "Daily Gacha" here.</p>

					<p>This is an example of a "featured gacha banner". There are multiple types of gacha in this game.</p>
					<ol>
						<li><strong>Permanent gacha:</strong> Features permanent units and arks. These units and arks will be available in all banners, including semi-limited and limited banners. They can also be obtained through gacha tickets.</li>
						<li><strong>Semi-limited gacha:</strong> Banners that return every so often, such as monthly Descent of Heroes banners.</li>
						<li><strong>Limited gacha:</strong> Seasonal banners such as the Christmas banner, and banners that feature collaboration units and arks, such as Secret of Mana units and Arks. These banners are the rarest and only rerun at the developer's discretion.</li>
					</ol>
					<div class="alert alert-warning" role="alert">
						<strong>Free players and low spenders should avoid pulling on permanent banners.</strong>

					<div class="alert alert-danger" role="alert">
						<p>Different gacha banners also have different featured unit/SSR rates. <strong>Always check the rates before pulling.</strong></p>

							<li><strong>Limited banners</strong> run anywhere from 0.5% to 1% per unit/Ark.</li>

						<p><strong>Medals</strong> are the pity currency in this game. Exchange them for units or arks in the Shop. <strong>Not every banner has a pity. Limited units cannot be pitied using their souls.</strong></p>
						<p>When pity is available, a single unit or SSR ark needs 90,000 crystals to acquire enough medals for pity.</p>

			<h4 id="startCurrencies">Explaining stamina</h4>
			<p>Last Cloudia is generally known as a "no stamina" game. The "no stamina" means that you can run stages an infinite amount of times without being gated by "stamina". <strong>This is only half true.</strong></p>
			<p>There is a "soft stamina" system in Last Cloudia where, if you plan on equipping Arks while entering combat, you will require a number of souls as an entry cost.</p>
			<div class="text-center"><image src="https://imagizer.imageshack.com/img924/7905/Yy3sKx.jpg"></image></div>
			<br />
			<p>In the above screenshot, we have an Ark equipped. That Ark costs 2,640 blue souls to use, which is also shown as <strong>Required Souls</strong> below the Start Quest button.</p>
			<p>90% of the time, you will want to equip Arks when entering battle. The only times when you <strong>don't</strong> want to equip Arks is when you are farming stages for souls (they drop in minuscule amounts per stage clear), or when you are out of souls.</p>
			<hr />
			<h4>Explaining currencies</h4>
			<br />
			<div class="text-center"><image src="https://imagizer.imageshack.com/img923/725/lFAuQj.jpg"></image></div>
			<br />
			<ol>
				<li>The gold coin is <strong>Zell</strong>, the main game currency. Zell is used to enhance units, purchase equipment and upgrade soul tanks and soul spots.</li>
				<li><strong>Crystals</strong> are the premium currency in this game. They are used for pulling on gacha and increasing friend slots.</li>
				<li>Blue orbs are known as "blue souls". Blue souls are obtained from unlocking and leveling soul spots dotted through the world map. You obtain a set amount each day, and sometimes, paid boosters are available to make them generate faster. <strong>Blue souls are used to level arks, learn ark skills, and level red soul spots and red soul tanks.</strong></li>
				<li>Red orbs are known as "red souls", and generate at a much lower rate than blue souls. <strong>Red souls are used to level arks and learn ark skills.</strong></li>

			<p>When you tap on the pink box in the right image, you are shown this popup. To play smart, you will want to change to Friend Points and stay on it forever.</p>
			<p>Sometimes event currencies are obtainable in friend gifts. The Ceremonial Badge shown below is an event currency. <strong>Remember to switch back to friend points when the event ends. The game will not do it automatically for you.</strong></p>

			<br />
			<h4 id="startSkillCost">Explaining skill cost (SC)</h4>
			<p><strong>Skill cost</strong>, or SC for short, is the main measurement of how strong your unit is. The most unique aspect of Last Cloudia's progression system is allowing any unit to learn <em>any Ark skill</em> as long as they have the right Arks and the right number of souls.</p>
			<p>To balance these Ark skills, each skill has a "cost" to equip. More skills = more SC required.</p>
			<div class="text-center"><image src="https://imagizer.imageshack.com/img923/2325/x3WC2K.jpg"></image></div>
			<br />
			<p>You will need to increase SC to equip more Ark skills. First, enter the Unit screen.</p>
			<div class="text-center"><image src="https://imagizer.imageshack.com/img923/6589/k4BoEi.jpg"></image></div>
			<br />
			<p>Then tap on the green button next to the SC counter.</p>

				<li><strong>Unit souls</strong> are souls specific to the unit, such as Kyle's souls. These souls can only be used on Kyle.</li>
				<li><strong>Mother souls</strong> can be used on any unit to increase their SC. Save those souls for limited units because it's much harder to obtain a limited unit's souls once their banner ends.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Once you're done increasing SC, you need to equip skills. Because I have no skills on Kyle, let's move to Saintly Theria.</p>
			<div class="text-center"><image src="https://imagizer.imageshack.com/img924/784/LDKgfa.jpg"></image></div>
			<br />
			<p>From top to bottom:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>The <strong>Reset button</strong> lets you reset all your equipped skills on that page. So if you are on the Magic page, all your spells will be unequipped, but your passives will still be equipped. It's useful for restarting a build.</li>
				<li>The <strong>Sorting and Filtering options</strong> is for when you have a few dozen skills learned and all the icons are painful to look at.</li>
				<li>The <strong>SC 0</strong> spells indicate that the unit has learned these spells from their ability tree. That means that the unit can equip them at no cost, and doesn't need the relevant Ark either. STheria learns Galaxy and Shining Zok from her ability tree, so she can equip them at no cost.</li>
				<li>The <strong>Browse Skill Set</strong> shows all the skills you have currently equipped. See below.</li>
			</ul>
			<div class="text-center"><image src="https://imagizer.imageshack.com/img923/924/FymrqN.jpg"></image></div>
			<br />
			<p>To view all the skills you have mastered, tap the Skills button on Kyle's main page.</p>
			<div class="text-center"><image src="https://imagizer.imageshack.com/img924/7062/kKVIrF.jpg"></image></div>
			<br />
			<p>And once again, because I have no skills on Kyle, I'll show you how this page looks like on Saintly Theria.</p>
			<div class="text-center"><image src="https://imagizer.imageshack.com/img924/4702/YecNl1.jpg"></image></div>
			<br />
			<p>This page monitors all the Ark skills you have learned or are in the progress of learning. It is very useful for forgetful people.</p>
			<p>Like me, who forgot I was making STheria learn Proud Force until I took this screenshot for this guide. By the time you're reading this, I probably forgot again.</p>

			<hr />
			<h4 id="startAbilityTree">Explaining unit ability trees</h4>
			<p>The most important upgrade path for your units is to max out their ability tree. It doesn't matter which nodes you unlock, because you should unlock them all (other than the 15SC node on 4th enhance, unless you need 80SC).</p>
			<p><strong>Important: The SC nodes on the ability tree unlock the SC cap – not the SC itself. You need unit souls or mother souls to increase usable SC.</strong></p>
			<p>Navigate to your unit screen, then press the Ability button.</p>
			<div class="text-center"><a href="https://imagizer.imageshack.com/img922/1742/ufliTy.jpg" target="_blank"><image src="https://imagizer.imageshack.com/img922/1742/ufliTy.jpg"></image></a></div>
			<br />
			<p>You need crystallites, crystals and crystal clusters to unlock ability tree nodes. See the images below as an example.</p>

			<h4 id="starter">New player goals</h4>
			<p>At the launch of the Global version, there was a very concise checklist passed around for new players. For some reason, that checklist has faded into obscurity, and we've been greeting confused new players for the past few months.</p>
			<p>I've reconstructed the checklist below.</p>
			<h4>Upgrade your soul spots as much as possible</h4>
			<p>Souls is the scarcest resource because it is time-gated and acts as a soft stamina bar for most activities in the game. Use your blue souls to upgrade red spots – you will need those reds to upgrade red Arks.</p>
			<div class="text-center"><a href="https://imagizer.imageshack.com/img924/3609/MKNsg6.jpg" target="_blank"><image src="https://imagizer.imageshack.com/img924/3609/MKNsg6.jpg"></image></a></div>
			<br />
			<p>You will unlock soul spots as you progress through Story. These include:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Blue Spot No. 1: Available from the start.
				<li>Red Spot No. 1: Available immediately after arriving at Port Aldana.</li>
				<li>Blue Spot No. 2: Available after clearing Royal Capital Aldana and recruiting Zekus.</li>
				<li>Red Spot No. 2: Available after clearing Dara Desert for the first time.</li>
				<li>Blue Spot No. 3: Available after clearing White Laboratory and recruiting Theria.</li>
				<li>Blue Spot No. 4: Available immediately after reaching the Lanzelia continent.</li>
				<li>Blue Spot No. 5: Available after clearing Evria Ice Caverns, right before Blaze Garden.</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="text-muted text-right">Taken from <a href="https://gamepress.gg/last-cloudia-beginners-guide">Greensburg's beginner guide</a>.</p>
			<p>As more Story content is added, more soul spots will open up, allowing players to increase their soul generation. When that happens, always prioritise new soul spots.</p>
			<h4>Upgrade your soul tanks</h4>
			<p>The higher your tank capacity, the more souls you can keep to upgrade SR and SSR arks with. <strong>DO NOT upgrade SSR arks early on. You need max level soul tanks to upgrade SSR arks to level 10.</strong></p>
			<p>New players should level their tanks to level 5 before focusing on other things.</p>

			<br />
			<h4>Be selective on which Arks to level</h4>
			<p>Until the Ark level selector (a feature to adjust Ark levels before entering combat) is added to Global, you will be stuck with high Ark level costs for some crucial Arks. Beware upgrading arks you don't immediately need.</p>
			<p>These are easy and important skills for early players:</p>

			<h4>Max out your friends list for friend points</h4>
			<p>The friend point exchange is one of the best sources of materials early on. Don't waste those points on the friend point gacha – use them for materials.</p>
			<p>Tap on the Shop icon on the home screen, then increase your friend slots on the top left.</p>

			<p>You can exchange by entering the Marketplace from the Shop on the homescreen. All materials in the friend shop exchange refresh daily, so the low quantity is not an issue.</p>

			<h4>Max out your Conquer slots ASAP</h4> 
			<p>Unit souls are used for increasing your unit's SC, which is used for equipping learned Ark skills (that cost SC). The amount of SC a unit has usually determines how strong/flexible that unit is in endgame.</p>
			<p>Conquer is an idling feature that lets you generate 4 <strong>unit souls</strong> per unit per slot every 20 hours. New players should prioritise reaching Blaze Garden because it unlocks the second set of Conquer slots.</p>
			<p><strong>Since SC is the largest bottleneck for endgame, the sooner you start, the sooner you finish endgame.</strong></p>
			<p>See the Basics section of the beginner guide for a more thorough explanation on SC and how to use SC.</p>

			<h4 id="level20">Walkthrough: From level 1 to level 20</h4>
			There are <strong>five Story units</strong> to unlock. You will start with Kyle, Lilebette and Rei – but you will obtain Zekus really soon, and Theria a while after.

			<h4>3-starring stages</h4>
			<p>As you play the game, you will run into stage goals that require certain spells to be cast.</p>
			<div class="text-center"><a href="https://imagizer.imageshack.com/img922/4451/Kg3pnB.jpg" target="_blank"><image src="https://imagizer.imageshack.com/img922/4451/Kg3pnB.jpg"></image></a></div>
			<br />
			<p><strong>We recommend that you return to these stages later instead of trying to 3-star them.</strong> These requirements usually ask for spells that are available on Story units (i.e. Lilebette or Zekus), and most players don't focus on their Story units if they rerolled for Gacha units.</p>
			<h4>Uncapping level 20 units</h4>
			<p>Uncapping your unit from level 20 to level 40 requires upgrade materials. You can obtain these materials from several sources.</p>
			<p><strong>Story maps</strong> like the free quest in Yggdrasil Tree are unlocked early on, and are easy to farm, but have low drop rates. See the <a href="https://potato-glitch.github.io/loottable">loot table</a> for exact drop rates.</p>

			<p>You can also obtain materials from the <strong>Friend point exchange</strong> and the Limit Breaker Field event dungeon (open weekdays).</p>
