		<p><h1>Beginner's guide</h1></p>
		<p>This page consolidates most of the launch advice, Greensburg's <a href="https://gamepress.gg/last-cloudia-beginners-guide">beginner's guide</a>, and my experience as a regular in #gl-help on Discord.</p>
		<p>If you are a new player, this page was written for you.</p>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>The basics</strong> is for explaining the various configurations and menu options available.</li>
			<li><strong>The walkthrough</strong> is for all new players up to their first level 80 units.</li>
			<li><strong>The crystal spending guide</strong> has tips on how to maximise crystal efficiency for players who don't spend much, or at all.</li>
			<li><strong>The reroll guide</strong> is for players who want to understand why certain arks are preferred over others for a "starting account". This section is written from the perspective of a gacha player for other gacha players.</li>
		</ul>
		<h4>Where do I ask other questions?</h4>
		<p>Ask in #gl-help on <a href="https://discord.gg/hYGG9Gt">Discord</a> or in the Questions megathread on <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/lastcloudia/">Reddit</a>.</p>
		<p>For any questions specific to the guide itself, ping @potato (me) on Discord. I don't have a Reddit account. <span class="text-white">You can DM me on Discord if you need to.</span></p>

					<p>Gachas use <strong>paid crystals</strong> or <strong>free crystals</strong>. The rates are the same, but paid crystals can be discounted, such as the "Daily Gacha" here.</p>
					<p>The <strong>pick-up details</strong> shows the details of the featured unit/arks at max level. <strong>Gacha details</strong> and <strong>probability</strong> show the details of the gacha banner, and the drop rate of all the possible units/arks in the banner respectively. </p>
					<p>This is an example of a "featured gacha banner". There are multiple types of gacha in this game.</p>
					<ol>
						<li><strong>Permanent gacha:</strong> Features permanent units and arks. These units and arks will be available in all banners, including semi-limited and limited banners. They can also be obtained through gacha tickets.</li>
						<li><strong>Semi-limited gacha:</strong> Banners that return every so often, such as monthly Descent of Heroes banners.</li>
						<li><strong>Limited gacha:</strong> Seasonal banners such as the Christmas banner, and banners that feature collaboration units and arks, such as Secret of Mana units and Arks. These banners are the rarest and only rerun at the developer's discretion.</li>
					</ol>
					<div class="alert alert-warning" role="alert">
						<strong>Free players and low spenders should avoid pulling on permanent banners.</strong>
					</div>
					<div class="alert alert-danger" role="alert">
						<p>Different gacha banners also have different featured unit/SSR rates. <strong>Always check the rates before pulling.</strong></p>
						<ol>
							<li><strong>Permanent gacha banners</strong> and <strong>rerun banners</strong> are usually at 1.5% featured rate-up.</li>
							<li><strong>Limited banners</strong> run anywhere from 0.5% to 1% per unit/Ark.</li>
						</ol>
						<p><strong>Medals</strong> are the pity currency in this game. Exchange them for units or arks in the Shop. <strong>Not every banner has a pity. Limited units cannot be pitied using their souls.</strong></p>
						<p>When pity is available, a single unit or SSR ark needs 90,000 crystals to acquire enough medals for pity.</p>

			<h4 id="startCurrencies">Explaining stamina</h4>
			<p>Last Cloudia is generally known as a "no stamina" game. The "no stamina" means that you can run stages an infinite amount of times without being gated by "stamina". <strong>This is only half true.</strong></p>
			<p>There is a "soft stamina" system in Last Cloudia where, if you plan on equipping Arks while entering combat, you will require a number of souls as an entry cost.</p>
			<div class="text-center"><image src="https://imagizer.imageshack.com/img924/7905/Yy3sKx.jpg"></image></div>
			<br />
			<p>In the above screenshot, we have an Ark equipped. That Ark costs 2,640 blue souls to use, which is also shown as <strong>Required Souls</strong> below the Start Quest button.</p>
			<p>90% of the time, you will want to equip Arks when entering battle. The only times when you <strong>don't</strong> want to equip Arks is when you are farming stages for souls (they drop in minuscule amounts per stage clear), or when you are out of souls.</p>
			<hr />
			<h4>Explaining currencies</h4>
			<br />
			<div class="text-center"><image src="https://imagizer.imageshack.com/img923/725/lFAuQj.jpg"></image></div>
			<br />
			<ol>
				<li>The gold coin is <strong>Zell</strong>, the main game currency. Zell is used to enhance units, purchase equipment and upgrade soul tanks and soul spots.</li>
				<li><strong>Crystals</strong> are the premium currency in this game. They are used for pulling on gacha and increasing friend slots.</li>
				<li>Blue orbs are known as "blue souls". Blue souls are obtained from unlocking and leveling soul spots dotted through the world map. You obtain a set amount each day, and sometimes, paid boosters are available to make them generate faster. <strong>Blue souls are used to level arks, learn ark skills, and level red soul spots and red soul tanks.</strong></li>
				<li>Red orbs are known as "red souls", and generate at a much lower rate than blue souls. <strong>Red souls are used to level arks and learn ark skills.</strong></li>

			<p>When you tap on the pink box in the right image, you are shown this popup. To play smart, you will want to change to Friend Points and stay on it forever.</p>

			<br />
			<h4 id="startSkillCost">Explaining skill cost (SC)</h4>
			<p><strong>Skill cost</strong>, or SC for short, is the main measurement of how strong your unit is. The most unique aspect of Last Cloudia's progression system is allowing any unit to learn <em>any Ark skill</em> as long as they have the right Arks and the enough souls.</p>
			<p>To balance these Ark skills, each skill has a "cost" to equip. More skills = more SC required.</p>
			<div class="text-center"><image src="https://imagizer.imageshack.com/img923/2325/x3WC2K.jpg"></image></div>
			<br />
			<p>You will need to increase SC to equip more Ark skills. First, enter the Unit screen.</p>
			<div class="text-center"><image src="https://imagizer.imageshack.com/img923/6589/k4BoEi.jpg"></image></div>
			<br />
			<p>Then tap on the green button next to the SC counter.</p>

				<li><strong>Unit souls</strong> are souls specific to the unit, such as Kyle's souls. These souls can only be used on Kyle.</li>
				<li><strong>Mother souls</strong> can be used on any unit to increase their SC. Save those souls for limited units because it's much harder to obtain a limited unit's souls once their banner ends.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Once you're done increasing SC, you need to equip skills. Because I have no skills on Kyle, let's move to Saintly Theria.</p>
			<div class="text-center"><image src="https://imagizer.imageshack.com/img924/784/LDKgfa.jpg"></image></div>
			<br />
			<p>From top to bottom:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>The <strong>Reset button</strong> lets you reset all your equipped skills on that page. So if you are on the Magic page, all your spells will be unequipped, but your passives will still be equipped. It's useful for restarting a build.</li>
				<li>The <strong>Sorting and Filtering options</strong> is for when you have a few dozen skills learned and all the icons are painful to look at.</li>
				<li>The <strong>SC 0</strong> spells indicate that the unit has learned these spells from their ability tree. That means that the unit can equip them at no cost, and doesn't need the relevant Ark either. STheria learns Galaxy and Shining Zok from her ability tree, so she can equip them at no cost.</li>
				<li>The <strong>Browse Skill Set</strong> shows all the skills you have currently equipped. See below.</li>
			</ul>
			<div class="text-center"><image src="https://imagizer.imageshack.com/img923/924/FymrqN.jpg"></image></div>

			<p>To view all the skills you have mastered, tap the Skills button on Kyle's main page.</p>
			<div class="text-center"><image src="https://imagizer.imageshack.com/img924/7062/kKVIrF.jpg"></image></div>

			<div class="text-center"><image src="https://imagizer.imageshack.com/img924/4702/YecNl1.jpg"></image></div>

			<p>This page monitors all the Ark skills you have learned or are in the progress of learning. It is very useful for forgetful people.</p>

			<h4 id="startAbilityTree">Explaining unit ability trees</h4>
			<p>The most important upgrade path for your units is to max out their ability tree. It doesn't matter which nodes you unlock, because you should unlock them all (other than the 15SC node on 4th enhance, unless you need 80SC).</p>
			<p><strong>Important: The SC nodes on the ability tree unlock the SC cap â€“ not the SC itself. You need unit souls or mother souls to increase usable SC.</strong></p>
			<p>Navigate to your unit screen, then press the Ability button.</p>

			<h4 id="starter">New player goals</h4>
			<p>At the launch of the Global version, there was a very concise checklist passed around for new players. For some reason, that checklist has faded into obscurity, and we've been greeting confused new players for the past few months.</p>
			<p>I've reconstructed the checklist below.</p>
			<h4>1. Focus on your main party (3 units) until level 60</h4>
			<p>One of the biggest mistakes early on is to spread your resources thin on your entire unit roster. <strong>Focus on the three units in your main party.</strong></p>
			<p>To gain EXP efficiently, swap a unit for another unit if you reach max level with them and can't enhance (uncap level) them ASAP.</p>
			<p>You can discard this advice when you reach level 60 because the level 60 enhance can take some time.</p>
			<h4>2. Upgrade your soul spots as much as possible</h4>
			<p>Souls is the scarcest resource because it is time-gated and acts as a soft stamina bar for most activities in the game. Use your blue souls to upgrade red spots â€“Â you will need those reds to upgrade red Arks.</p>
			<div class="text-center"><a href="https://imagizer.imageshack.com/img924/3609/MKNsg6.jpg" target="_blank"><image src="https://imagizer.imageshack.com/img924/3609/MKNsg6.jpg"></image></a></div>
			<br />
			<p>You will unlock soul spots as you progress through Story. These include:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Blue Spot No. 1: Available from the start.
				<li>Red Spot No. 1: Available immediately after arriving at Port Aldana.</li>
				<li>Blue Spot No. 2: Available after clearing Royal Capital Aldana and recruiting Zekus.</li>
				<li>Red Spot No. 2: Available after clearing Dara Desert for the first time.</li>
				<li>Blue Spot No. 3: Available after clearing White Laboratory and recruiting Theria.</li>
				<li>Blue Spot No. 4: Available immediately after reaching the Lanzelia continent.</li>
				<li>Blue Spot No. 5: Available after clearing Evria Ice Caverns, right before Blaze Garden.</li>
				<li>Red Spot No. 3: Available after clearing Kaldina Ruins on the Odal Continent (latest story update).</li>

			<p>As more Story content is added, more soul spots will open up, allowing players to increase their soul generation. When that happens, always prioritise new soul spots.</p>
			<h4>3. Upgrade your soul tanks</h4>
			<p>The higher your tank capacity, the more souls you can keep to upgrade SR and SSR arks with. <strong>DO NOT upgrade SSR arks early on. You need max level soul tanks to upgrade SSR arks to level 10.</strong></p>
			<p>New players should level their tanks to level 5 before focusing on other things.</p>

			<br />
			<h4>4. Be selective on which Arks to level</h4>
			<p>Until the Ark level selector (a feature to adjust Ark levels before entering combat) is added to Global, you will be stuck with high Ark level costs for some crucial Arks. Beware upgrading arks you don't immediately need.</p>
			<p>These are easy and important skills for early players:</p>

			<h4>5. Max out your friends list for friend points</h4>
			<p>The friend point exchange is one of the best sources of materials early on. Don't waste those points on the friend point gacha â€“ use them for materials.</p>

			<h4>6. Max out your Conquer slots ASAP</h4> 
			<p>Unit souls are used for increasing your unit's SC, which is used for equipping learned Ark skills (that cost SC). The amount of SC a unit has usually determines how strong/flexible that unit is in endgame.</p>
			<p>Conquer is an idling feature that lets you generate 4 <strong>unit souls</strong> per unit per slot every 20 hours. New players should prioritise reaching Blaze Garden because it unlocks the second set of Conquer slots.</p>
			<p><strong>Since SC is the largest bottleneck for endgame, the sooner you start, the sooner you finish endgame.</strong></p>
			<div class="alert alert-info" role="alert">
				See the Basics section of the beginner guide for a more thorough explanation on SC and how to use SC.

			<br />
			<h4>7. Use your unit souls for SC</h4> 
			<p>Unit souls are used for two purposes: awakening units, and increasing the unit's SC.</p>
			<p>Awakening is when you upgrade a unit's base stats and their Special, also known as Ultimate. The costs for Awakening any unit is fixed:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Level 1: 30 souls</li>
				<li>Level 2: 60 souls</li>
				<li>Level 3: 90 souls</li>
				<li>Level 4: 150 souls</li>
			</ol>
			<p>You can see an example of the Awaken screen below.</p>
			<div class="text-center"><a href="https://imagizer.imageshack.com/img923/6006/cw3St7.jpg" target="_blank"><image src="https://imagizer.imageshack.com/img923/6006/cw3St7.jpg"></image></a></div>
			<br />
			<p><strong>Our recommended strategy is to:</strong></p>
			<ol>
				<li>Increase unit to 30 SC</li>
				<li>Awaken to +2 (30 souls, then 60 souls)</li>
				<li>Increase unit SC to 50 SC</li>
				<li>Awaken to +4 (90 souls, then 150 souls)</li>
				<li>(Optional) Finish increasing SC to 60-80</li>
			</ol>
			<p>The reasoning for this strategy is that you achieve a balanced progression between base stats, upgrading your Ultimate, and equipping important Ark skills.</p>

			<h4>3-starring stages</h4>

			<br />
			<p><strong>We recommend that you return to these stages later instead of trying to 3-star them.</strong> These requirements usually ask for spells that are available on Story units (i.e. Lilebette or Zekus), and most players don't focus on their Story units if they rerolled for Gacha units.</p>
			<h4>Uncapping level 20 units</h4>
			<p>Uncapping your unit from level 20 to level 40 requires upgrade materials. You can obtain these materials from several sources.</p>

			<h4>Beating Zouglas, the boss in Blaze Garden</h4>
			<p>It is actually possible to reach Blaze Garden and beat Zouglas at level 40 without assists.</p>
			<p>However, you'll need to know what you are doing, such as equipping the right Arks and pairing the right Units against him. For most players, it is much safer to face Zouglas when they reach level 45-50.</p>
			<p>Nevertheless, here are a few strategies.</p>
			<ul>
			<li>Bring a Light mage, and have them equip your strongest Ark (for most players this will be a level 10 Sorcerer's Eden or Grave of the Blademaster). Then spam Galaxy until Zouglas is dead. Beware his Dark spells â€“ it can wipe your party if you're not careful. Always keep him debuffed with Lostoma and your party buffed with Barrier/Protection.</li>
			<li>Another strategy is to use Shin, Randi or any other PDPS unit with either Light element, Neutral element or the God Slayer passive (Zouglas is God type).</li>
			<li>You can cheese Zouglas by bringing a lv60-80+ Support unit (i.e. a mage Lily or mage Saintly Theria) and controlling them for the duration of the fight.</li>
			</ul>

			<p>A few tips:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Remember to gift your friends every day.</strong> It's free Friend points, and you will want as many Friend points as possible for a possible Friend Gacha campaign in the future.</li>
				<li><strong>Don't forget to collect Conquer souls every day.</strong> And don't worry about micro-managing it â€“ just treat 20 hours as 24 hours every day.</li>
				<li><strong>Check into the game twice a day to collect souls.</strong> Souls will usually fill twice a day with maxed out soul tanks.</li>
				<li><strong>Save your crystals for limited banners.</strong> You will gain nearly 90,000 crystals over the entire Story mode. Save those crystals for limited banners because you can obtain all permanent Units and Arks in limited banners.</li>
				<li><strong>Don't be afraid to ask questions.</strong> The community is there for you to benefit from.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Whatever you do from this point forward is up to your priorities. We wish you the best of luck on your journey in Last Cloudia.</p>
			<p>Thanks for reading!</p>

			<h4>Why reroll?</h4>
			<p>A recent update added infinite reroll at the start of the game. This pool is sporadically updated with the latest permanent Units and Arks (i.e. all permanent Units and Arks that are older than 2-4 weeks).</p>
			<p>The reroll screen will look like this:</p>
			<div class="text-center"><a href="https://imagizer.imageshack.com/img922/9166/V2gIDH.jpg" target="_blank"><image src="https://imagizer.imageshack.com/img922/9166/V2gIDH.jpg"></image></a></div>
			<br />
			<p>(I stole this screenshot from #gl-reroll on Discord because the poster lucksacked. Your roll will probably not look this good on your first few tries.)</p>
			<h4>How to reroll</h4>
			<p>A good reroll should have a meta Unit + several meta SSR arks. The Unit can be used immediately, while the SSR arks can be used in midgame to endgame.</p>
			<p>The reasoning is simple: you are not guaranteed to obtain these SSRs in a sea of RNG. <strong>Unit of choice tickets do not exist in Global (yet).</strong></p>
			<div class="alert alert-info" role="alert">
				<strong>Aim for 2-3+ SSR arks in your final roll.</strong> Arks take priority over Units because many of the best Units are limited.<br />If there is a limited banner ongoing, you want 2+ SSR arks on the tutorial roll before pulling for your preferred limited unit on their banner.
			</div>
			<div class="alert alert-info" role="alert">
				<strong>For detailed information on all units and Arks, see the <a href="https://potato-glitch.github.io/tiers">tier list</a>.</strong> Keep in mind that the tier list isn't written for new players.

					<ul>
						<li><strong>Farmer</strong> â€“Â Important for farming high rarity materials such as level 60 enhance materials, rainbow crystal clusters, and level 80 enhance materials such as Light of the World and Foreign Light.</li>
						<li><strong>Strong melee physical DPS</strong> â€“Â All of PTRobin's skills activate fast and he has high innate movement speed. Two of his skills are also neutral element damage, allowing him to clear most content without worrying about element resistances.</li>
						<li><strong>Usable in all modes</strong> â€“Â Strong for Story and Tower, and a meta unit in Arena.</li>

					<ul>
						<li><strong>Strong melee physical DPS</strong> â€“Â Sevia has high innate movement speed and extremely fast skills. Sevia's main damage-dealing skills are also Neutral element, allowing her to ignore element resistances for Story and Tower.</li>
						<li><strong>Incredibly strong defensive Ultimate</strong> â€“Â Sevia's Ultimate buffs her allies with 50% reduction to physical and magic damage taken. The buff is invaluable in endgame and Tower of Trials, where your party regularly takes chunks of damage from bosses and tough mobs.</li>

					<ul>

					<ul>
						<li><strong>Restores party's SCT by 15 seconds each wave (Ark passive)</strong> â€“Â reduces skill charge time (the time needed for skills to be usable) for all allies every wave. Extremely useful in all content.</li>
						<li><strong>Grants party Flinch resistance for first 10 seconds of battle (Ark passive)</strong> â€“Â the only Ark passive to grant party-wide anti-flinch. Game-changing for physical DPS units in harder content.</li>
						<li><strong>Determination (skill)</strong> â€“Â The best auto-revive passive. Keeps you alive with some HP after taking lethal damage. You won't actually "die", so you'll retain all your buffs.</li>
						<li><strong>Pirate's Feast (skill)</strong> â€“Â Maxes out all your physical skills' charges after a wave ends. Excellent for farming and harder multi-wave stages, because you'll be able to spam all of your skills as soon as the fight starts. Useless in 1-wave stages or Arena.</li>

						<li><strong>Ardor (skill)</strong> â€“Â Critical rate +10% at max HP. Incredibly useful on any unit with Proud Force (skill, recover HP on critical hit) equipped.</li>
						<li><strong>Knight Slayer (skill)</strong> â€“Â Increase damage against Knight type units. Helps murders a good percentage of enemies in Arena and Tower. Highly recommended.</li>

						<li><strong>Archangel Blessing (skill)</strong> â€“Â The best MP recovery passive, usually used in combination with Magic Aura for endgame. 30% MP recovery at the end of each wave.</li>

					<ul>
						<li><strong>Break level +120% (Ark passive)</strong> â€“Â The single best buff for Break/Faint units in the game. Helps cheese a number of bosses by melting their Break bars instantly with the right units (i.e. Zekus or Vaughn)</li>
						<li><strong>Skill Charge 1 (skill)</strong> â€“Â Lets you start each wave with some charges on your first (top-left) skill. Meta for Arena and any high difficulty fight. Synergises really well with Zekus.</li>

						<li><strong>Lapis Axe Jilven (Ark ether reward)</strong> â€“Â The highest STR weapon in the game, and also increases Counter damage by +100%. Counter is a rarely used mechanic in the game, but it's still something.</li>

						<li><strong>Fast Metis (skill)</strong> â€“Â Start each wave with +20% MND. Great for healers, since healing spells scale off MND.</li>
						<li><strong>Light High Boost (skill)</strong> â€“Â Boosts light damage by +30%. Because Light mages are the most popular in the game (half the game is Light weak), this is one of the best mage passives.</li>
						<li><strong>Maja's Wand (Ark ether reward)</strong> â€“Â The single best staff for any Light mage that also increases Light magic damage by +30%. Stacks with Light High Boost, because we definitely needed more Light damage inflation.</li>

			<h4>What are crystals?</h4>
			<p>Crystals are the premium currency in Last Cloudia. Crystals are divided between <strong>paid crystals</strong> and <strong>free crystals</strong>.</p>
			<p>You can view your number of paid and free crystals by navigating to <code>Settings > Other > Purchase Information</code> from the Home screen.</p>
			<div class="text-center"><a href="https://imagizer.imageshack.com/img923/3299/7bB730.jpg" target="_blank"><image src="https://imagizer.imageshack.com/img923/3299/7bB730.jpg"></image></a></div>
			<br />
			<h4>How to obtain free crystals</h4>
			<p>There are a number of methods to obtain Crystals in the game. <strong>There is no guaranteed daily income of crystals. However, you can obtain a sizeable number of crystals by pursuing fixed sources of crystals.</strong></p>
			<p>Fixed sources of free crystals:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Normal missions â€“Â especially the "Log in x number of days" missions.</li>
				<li>Leveling up Arks (levels 2, 4, 7, 10)</li>
				<li>Leveling up Units (levels 10, 30, 50, 80)</li>
				<li>Clearing stage missions</li>
				<li>Clearing stages for the first time</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Fluctuating sources of free crystals:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Event missions.</li>
				<li>Clearing event stage missions</li>
				<li>Clearing event stages for the first time</li>
				<li>Monthly login rewards</li>
				<li>Event login rewards</li>
				<li>Extended maintenance compensation rewards</li>
				<li>Bug compensation rewards</li>
			</ol>
			<br />
			<h4>Advice for light spenders</h4>
			<p>Every so often, the developers will come out with special crystal packages that include Mother Souls that cost roughly $80 USD each. If you are keen to support the game and are not so keen on the high prices, these special packages offer the most value for your dollar.</p>
			<p><strong>Do NOT buy the level up packs or the guaranteed SSR ticket packs.</strong> There are very few worse things you can throw your paid crystals onto. The SSR pool is already too large to hope for specific Arks or Units, and the level up packs are redundant if you've played longer than a month.</p>
			<p>The developer has confirmed that a monthly subscription deal will come soon. No further details have been provided.</p>
			<h4>Purchase the boosters</h4>
			<p>Every month or two, boosters will be made available for 2 weeks. These boosters will always expire at the specified time, so the sooner you purchase them, the longer you benefit.</p>
			<p>The <strong>soul gain booster</strong> is the best value for money in terms of anything you can purchase. It doubles soul regeneration rate, effectively allowing newer players to catch up to older players in half the time.</p>
			<p>The <strong>EXP gain booster</strong> and <strong>AP gain booster</strong> are only recommended for newer players so that they can reach endgame in less time.</p>

			<h4>Further advice</h4>
			<p><strong>Not all paid equipment are worthwhile.</strong> Always check the equipment passives and community consensus before deciding to spend for them. For example, very few equipment are as game-breaking as Davan's paid Axe.</p>
			<p><strong>You don't need to pay to keep up with the latest meta.</strong> As long as you have a built team, you can still clear the hardest content in the game with launch Units and Arks.</p>
			<p><strong>Most crystals in this game are obtained by playing the game.</strong> Last Cloudia is not a pull simulator. Play Dragalia Lost or Destiny Child if all you care about is pulling on the gacha.</p>
			<p><strong>Always check the featured Unit and Ark banner rates before pulling.</strong> It's become a recent trend for AIDIS to screw around with the rates. Some banners will have 1% featured rate, others will have 1.5%, and a few select banners (with multiple units) will have 0.5% rate up. Checking before pulling will help you make informed decisions as to whether a banner is worth your time.</p>
